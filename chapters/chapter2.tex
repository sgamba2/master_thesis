\chapter{The Mu2e Experiment}\label{mu2echapter}
\textit{
The Mu2e experiment aims to investigate the phenomenon of charged-lepton flavour 
violating (CLFV) neutrino-less conversion, where a negative muon transitions into 
an electron within the field of a Aluminium nucleus. The experiment will measure 
the ratio between the conversion and the nuclear muon capture rates:
\begin{equation}\label{rmue}
R_{\mu e}=\frac{\mu^{-}+N(Z, A) \rightarrow e^{-}+N(Z, A)}{\mu^{-}+N(Z, A) \rightarrow \nu_\mu+N(Z-1, A)}
\end{equation}
The goal is to improve the current limit, set by the SINDRUM-II experiment, 
Ref. \cite{SINDRUMII:2006dvw}, by
four orders of magnitude and reach a SES (single-event-sensitivity) of 3 $\times$ 
10$^{-17}$ on the
conversion rate, a 90\% CL of 8 $\times$ 10$^{-17}$ and a 5$\sigma$ discovery 
reach at 2 $\times$ 10$^{-16}$.
Mu2e is presently undergoing commissioning, integration and testing stages at the 
Fermilab Muon Campus, 
with contributions from an international Collaboration. Data taking is planned to 
begin in 2026. 
This Chapter provides an overview of the Mu2e experimental techniques and infrastructures.

\section{Experiment concept}
A beam of negative muons, $\mu ^-$, is generated by directing a proton beam at a 
production target, yielding negative pions along with other mesons and hadrons. 
Pions, with a decay rate of more than 99.9\% due to helicity suppression, undergo 
$\pi ^- \rightarrow \mu ^- \bar{\nu}_\mu$ decay in flight. 
Accumulating sufficient statistical data within a realistic timeframe necessitates 
an intense muon beamline. 
Low-momentum secondary muons are trapped by a Stopping Target (ST) to form muonic atoms. 
Within approximately $10^{-13}$ s, 
a muonic atom transitions to the $1s$ state, Ref. \cite{MEASDAY2001243}. 
Given the brief cascading time compared to the mean muon lifetime in a muonic atom, 
typically around $10^{-6}$ s, 
instances of muon decay before reaching the ground state are negligible. 
The cascades emit x-ray photons, aiding in estimating the number of muons captured 
on the ST. 
Muonic atoms decay after a specific lifetime determined by the ST material. 
In the Mu2e experiment, an Aluminum ST is utilized resulting in a lifetime of 
864 ns. Muon decay occurs primarily through two processes: 
nuclear capture $\mu^- N \rightarrow \nu_\mu N'^* $, where $N'^*$ represents an excited 
Magnesium nucleus, and muon decay-in-orbit (DIO), 
that is the three-body decay with neutrinos $\mu ^- N \rightarrow e^- N \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_e$. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:muonicatom}, the ratio between these 
processes varies with the ST material. For $^{27}$Al, approximately 60.9\% 
of muonic atoms undergo muon nuclear capture. The remaining 39.1\% undergo muon DIO. 
The experiment aims to identify a third decay mode, neutrinoless muon-to-electron 
conversion $\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N $. Detectors are designed to detect the signature of a 
single monoenergetic electron: this will be explored further in the next sections.
The Mu2e experiment can also detect the lepton-number violation process 
$\mu^- N \rightarrow e^+ N'$.
This process violates both the charged lepton flavour and the total lepton 
number ($|\Delta L|$ = 2). 
Conversion positrons tracks helices in the tracker, but with different chirality from electrons. 
\section{Signals and Backgrounds}\label{sigandbkg}
\subsection{Conversion Electron Signal}
The conversion of a muon to an electron in the field of a nucleus is coherent: 
the muon recoils off the entire nucleus and follows two-body decay kinematics, 
Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}. The mass of the nucleus is large compared to the 
mass of the electron, hence the recoil terms are minimal. The outgoing nucleus 
remains in the ground state and as a result the Conversion Electron (CE) is 
monochromatic with an energy slightly lower than the muon's rest mass:
\begin{equation}
    E_{CE} = m_\mu - E_{recoil}(A) - E_{bind}(Z) 
\end{equation}
where $m_\mu$ is the muon mass, $E_{recoil}\simeq \frac{m^2_\mu}{2 m_N}$ is 
the recoil energy of the target nucleus, with $m_N$ the nucleus mass, and 
$E_{bind}\simeq \frac{Z^2 \alpha^2 m_\mu}{2}$ is the binding energy of the 
$1s$ state of the muonic atom, Ref. \cite{universe9010054}. For the Mu2e 
ST material, $^{27}$Al, $E_{CE}$ = 104.97 MeV, Ref. \cite{PhysRevD.84.013006}.
\subsection{Backgrounds}\label{backgrounds}
In order to achieve a sensitivity improvement of four orders of magnitude, 
it is important to know all experimental backgrounds that could interfere with 
the process $\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N $. Any source capable of producing 105 MeV 
electrons may introduce background. There are five categories of background 
sources, Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item electrons or muons coming from cosmic rays;
\item intrinsic phenomena that vary in accordance with beam intensity, as muon 
Decay-in-Orbit (DIO) and Radiative Muon Capture (RMC);
\item processes that are delayed because of particles that spiral slowly down the 
muon beam line, such as antiprotons;
\item prompt processes where the detected electron is nearly coincident in time with 
the arrival of a beam particle at the muon ST (e.g. radiative pion capture (RPC), 
Pion or Muon Decay-in-Fight);
\item reconstruction errors due to accidental activities.
\end{enumerate}
The detailed discussion of these background sources will be provided below, along 
with the corresponding methods for mitigation. Next section will focus on introducing 
how these mitigation techniques are applied in the Mu2e experimental design, highlighting 
the experiment setup.
\subsubsection{Cosmic rays}
Cosmic-ray particles, predominantly cosmic-ray muons, also contribute to the experiment 
background. Several mechanisms are listed here:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item muon decays occurring within or near the detectors;
    \item muons interacting with nuclei within detectors or surrounding materials;
    \item muons scattering within the detectors and being erroneously identified as electrons;
    \item muons entering the muon beamline with specific initial momentum, either 
    interacting with collimators to produce electrons or proceeding down the muon 
    beamline and being misidentified.
\end{enumerate}

While enhanced reconstruction algorithms can correctly identify cosmic-ray muons in 
certain instances, there are scenarios where signals induced by cosmic rays are 
indistinguishable from Conversion Electrons. The quantity of cosmic-ray-induced 
backgrounds is proportional to the duration of data collection, with the rate being 
experiment-specific. Detailed simulations estimated that in the Mu2e experiment, 
conversion-like signals generated by cosmic rays occur approximately once per day, 
potentially overwhelming actual conversion signals, Ref. \cite{CRVposter}. Mitigation 
involves making use of a combination of active veto and shielding within the experiment. 
As shown in Section \ref{CRV}, a high-efficiency veto system is capable of effectively 
reducing cosmic-ray-induced backgrounds to an acceptable level.
\subsubsection{Intrinsic Backgrounds}
The intrinsic backgrounds in the experiment originate from two physics processes: 
muon decay-in-orbit (DIO) and radiative muon capture (RMC). In this context, 
$intrinsic$ denotes that the rates of these backgrounds are directly correlated 
with the number of muons captured on the ST.
\paragraph{Muon Decay-in-Orbit}
Electrons energy coming from the three body decay of a free muon, 
$\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \bar{\nu}_e \nu_\mu$, is described by the Michel 
spectrum. The differential decay rate can be computed, Ref. \cite{michel}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\text{d}\Gamma_{\text{free}}}{\text{d}x}= \frac{G^2_F m^5_\mu}{192 \pi^3}x^2(6-4x+\frac{\alpha}{x}f(x)) 
\end{equation}
where $x=\frac{2 E_e}{m_\mu}$, $0\leq x\leq 1$, $G_F$ is the Fermi constant, 
$\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $m_\mu$ is the muon mass, $E_e$ is the 
electron energy and $f (x)$ represents a complicated radiative correction term, 
described in Ref. \cite{PhysRev.113.1652}. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:linearscalemichel}, the spectrum exhibits a peak energy 
at 52.8 MeV, constituting half of the muon rest energy  or the energy of the searched 
Conversion Electron. However, the presence of an Al nucleus allows the electron to 
interact with it, exchanging momentum and resulting in a maximum possible energy, 
$endpoint$ $energy$, that closely matches that of the Conversion Electron (negligible 
neutrino energy in this scenario). The difference between the two energy spectra, one 
neglecting the nuclear recoil and the 
other in the presence of the Al nucleus, is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:micheldiff}. 
Figure \ref{fig:logscalemichel} presents a more detailed examination of the high-energy 
range of the spectrum. When the electron energy $E_e \ \geq$ 85 MeV, the dominant term 
at the leading order scales with $(E_{\mu e} - E_e)^5$, Ref. \cite{PhysRevD.84.013006}, 
resulting in a low rate within the energy range very close to the endpoint. However, in 
actual experimental conditions, due to uncertainties in reconstructions and the energy 
loss of particles when interacting with ST or detector materials, the monoenergetic 
Conversion Electrons tend to be reconstructed with a left-skewed energy distribution, 
with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) approximately on the order of 1 MeV, Ref. 
\cite{gaponenko}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity}. Consequently, the 
high-energy electrons originating from muon DIO and the Conversion Electrons 
become indistinguishable. To limit the DIO background, Mu2e detectors are 
designed to be blind to the majority of low-energy electrons. A particle 
tracking detector with high momentum resolution also helps to reduce background 
noise, which will be explored in next sections.

\label{fig:micheldiff}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{Radiative Muon Capture}

The Radiative Muon Capture (RMC) differs from ordinary muon nuclear capture by 
producing an additional photon. In the process $\mu^- N \rightarrow\gamma \nu_\mu N'^* $, 
the photon can either be real or virtual. The photon, interacting with matter or 
undergoing pair production, can produce electrons with energies close to $E_{CE}$, 
introducing background signals to the experiment. The emitted photon's energy follows 
a spectrum, with its maximum energy, denoted as the kinematic limit $k_{max}$, 
determined by the equation (Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}):

\begin{equation}
k_{max} = m_\mu c^2 - |E_b| - E_{rec} - \Delta M ,
\end{equation}

where $E_b$ represents the muon binding energy on the initial nucleus, $E_{rec}$ denotes 
the recoil energy of the daughter nucleus and $\Delta M$ is the rest energy difference 
between the final and initial nuclides. This formula neglects higher order nuclear effects. 
RMC can be effectively mitigated in the Mu2e experiment by selecting Aluminum as the ST material. The ST is selected so that the daughter nuclide of a muon-capture 
process of any kind is heavier than the original nuclide. For aluminum, the RMC endpoint energy 
is 101.9 MeV, approximately 3.1 MeV below the Conversion Electron energy, Ref. 
\cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}. 
The planned FWHM of the conversion peak is around 1 MeV, therefore the RMC background will be 
outside the signal region. However, the RMC background might distort the DIO spectra 
in the 80-100 MeV 
range, making it difficult to extrapolate to the endpoint. Determining the RMC 
background from the data will be a crucial part of the experiment.
\subsubsection{Prompt Processes}
This type of background sources can generate electrons at roughly the same time as 
the entering beam particles. There are four primary sources: radiative pion capture (RPC), 
pion decay-in-flight ($\pi$-DIF), muon decay-in-flight ($\mu$-DIF) and beam electrons.
\paragraph{Radiative Pion Capture}
The secondary muon beam carries a considerable quantity of pions.  It is not excluded 
that some pions can reach the ST. Pions, when captured in materials, can 
produce a high-energy photon, i.e. $\pi^- N(A,Z) \rightarrow \gamma N ^* (A,Z-1)$. 
This phenomenon, called radiative pion capture, is observed in approximately 2\% of 
pions captured in Aluminum, Ref. \cite{PhysRevC.5.1867}. Similar to RMC, the photon 
can internally convert into an electron-positron pair or emit an on-shell photon, 
leading to pair production. The external pair-production depends on the thickness 
of the material. The resulting electrons can contribute to the experiment background. 
Despite its similarity to RMC, RPC is a more challenging background to suppress due to 
the fact that the endpoint of the energy spectrum of photons, and consequently the 
resulting electrons, is not constrained by the rest energy of the muon. The mass of 
a pion is 139.6 MeV, which is much higher than the conversion energy. Consequently, 
there exists no energy separation between the search range for Conversion Electrons 
and the electron energy spectrum originating from RPC photons. The SINDRUM II results 
were limited by the pion-induced background and also by the low intensity of its muon 
beam, Ref. \cite{SINDRUMII:2006dvw}. SINDRUM II used a primary proton beam with a 
frequency of one pulse every 19.75 ns, lasting approximately 0.3 ns. This interval 
between pulses was shorter than the 26 ns lifetime of pions, Ref. \cite{zyla}, 
ensuring a consistent pion flux. To mitigate RPC, SINDRUM II made use of a degrader to suppress 
pions and a veto counter in the beam, resulting in less than one out of 10$^9$ pions reaching their 
target. However, given the more intense beam, the Mu2e experiment has to change the approach. 
Mu2e uses a pulsed proton beam. Given their brief lifetime, nearly all pions decay or 
interact with materials shortly after the pulse of the proton beam. The RPC background 
can be suppressed by opening a live window for Conversion Electron search at a right time. 
One important point to note is that in the event of protons coming out of the beam pulse, 
out-of-time, the resultant pions could still contribute to RPC background. Consequently, 
it is important for the pulsed beam to achieve a high extinction level, ensuring that the 
ratio of out-of-time to in-time RPC remains below a specified threshold. Further elaboration 
on the pulsed beam used in Mu2e will be provided in Section \ref{accel}.
\paragraph{$\pi$-DIF and $\mu$-DIF}
The decay-in-flight of the pion ($\pi$-DIF) and the decay-in-flight of the muon ($\mu$-DIF) exhibit quite similar characteristics. Free pions and muons can 
undergo electron decay while transitioning from the production target to the ST, through the processes $\mu^- \rightarrow e^- \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_e$ and $\pi^- \rightarrow e^- \bar{\nu}_e$. In the center-of-mass frame of the initial particles, electrons originating from the first process exhibit an energy spectrum that reaches an endpoint of 52.8 MeV, while those from the second process have a consistent energy of approximately 70 MeV. As the pions and muons move at relativistic velocities, the energies (and momenta) of the resultant electrons are boosted. For instance, a muon with a momentum of around 79 MeV/c or a pion with momentum close to 70 MeV/c can generate an electron with an energy of 105 MeV, Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}. Implementing a pulsed proton beam and using a delayed live window can help suppress background from $\pi$-DIF and $\mu$-DIF events. Particles with sufficient momentum to boost the daughter electrons to the concerning energies move quickly along the muon beamline and are gone by the time the live search window begins, Ref. \cite{bobbb}. In addition, the shape of the Mu2e detectors contributes to mitigation.
\paragraph{Beam electrons}\label{beamelectrons}
Other mechanisms generate electrons, both at the production target and along the muon beamline. For instance, neutral pions formed at the production target can decay in two photons, after which the photons can either create electron-pairs or interact with nearby materials to generate electrons. Other beam particles can decay or interact at any point before the muon ST, producing electrons with energy equal to $E_{CE}$. These sources of background are called beam electrons and it is possible to reduce them through the pulsed beam and the delayed live window. Moreover, Mu2e uses a set of solenoids to generate a magnetic field across the muon beamline and in the area of the ST and detectors. A charged particle follows a spiral trajectory when a magnetic field is applied, where the size and shape of the spiral are determined by the particle's electric charge and its parallel and perpendicular to magnetic field components of momentum. This brings to the installation of collimators along the muon beamline to suppress the number of high-momentum particles exceeding 100 MeV/c, Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}. Moreover, the magnetic field is 
designed with a gradient in proximity of the ST. This gradient effectively divides the paths of Conversion Electrons from those originating upstream, unless they undergo scattering within the ST, Ref. \cite{bobbb}. Solenoid system and the magnetic field will be deeply explored in Section \ref{setup}.
\subsubsection{Delayed processes from antiprotons}
Protons, at a given threshold, can generate antiprotons within the production target. This occurs through the process of antiproton production: $pp \rightarrow ppp\bar{p}$. The minimum kinetic energy of the initial proton beam can be found applying 4-momentum conservation principles to the system. 
If we consider that all four particles in the final state are at rest in the center of mass frame, the minimum kinetic energy needed for $p\bar{p}$ production can be found, which is approximately $6 m_pc^2 \sim 5.6$ GeV, where $m_p$ is the mass of the proton. In an ideal scenario, maintaining the beam energy below this threshold could enable us to avoid this background in the experiment. Unfortunately, the Mu2e proton beam goes beyond the threshold for antiproton production. The antiprotons are long-lived and massive. Antiprotons with momenta below 100 MeV/c travel at speeds less than 0.1$c$, requiring several $\mu$s to spiral from the production target to the ST, Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}. They have the correct charge and momentum to pass through the collimators placed between the production target and the ST. Annihilating or undergoing interactions with other materials, they have the capability to release a substantial amount of energy, generating numerous secondary electrons. The time delay connected with these interactions significantly exceeds the muon lifetime, leading to a continual flow of antiprotons reaching the ST. The pulsed beam and the delayed live window fail to suppress the antiproton background. The best approach is to prevent the antiprotons from reaching the region where the ST is located. A thin absorber is positioned in the muon beamline to capture the antiprotons. Its design was developed to find a compromise between increasing antiproton absorption and decreasing muon beam loss.
\subsubsection{Accidental activity}
This final background category arises not from the physical interactions of a specific particle, but rather from the accidental reconstruction of extra events in the detectors, miming conversion-like signals. During the muon-capture process, nuclei in excited states can expel protons, neutrons and photons. These expelled protons have high ionization potential, producing large signals in the detectors and increasing the likelihood of reconstruction errors. Additionally, other coincidences, such as multiple muon decay-in-orbit occurring in close succession, can also contribute to reconstruction errors. To suppress the flux of protons from the muon-capture process reaching the detectors, additional polyethylene absorbers are used to surround the ST in the Mu2e experiment. A systematic uncertainty is evaluated as part of the background analysis to take into account these accidental events.

\subsection{Backgrounds estimates and Signal Sensitivity}
Mu2e run plan is divided in two different phases. Run I will take place in 2026, before a 2 years shutdown due to the 
planned accelerator upgrade for the long baseline neutrino program. In Run I phase one, a low intensity proton beam, 
$1.6 \times 10^7$ protons/pulse, will be used. In Run I phase two, the mean intensity will be increased up to $3.9 \times 10^7$ 
protons/pulse. The total number of stopped muons will be $6 \times 10^{16}$, corresponding to the 10\% of the number required to 
satisfy the Mu2e goals in the complete data-taking. As discussed in Ref. \cite{universe9010054}, the 5 $\sigma$ discovery sensitivity is 
$R_{\mu e}^{5 \sigma} = 1.2 \times 10^{-15} $, with a total expected background of 0.11$\pm$0.03 events. 
Reaching the 5$\sigma$ significance level requires observing 5 $\mu\rightarrow e$ events in the two-dimensional search window 
103.60 < $p$ < 104.90 MeV/c, 640 < $T_0$ < 1650 ns. In the absence of a signal, the expected upper limit is $R_{\mu e}$<$6.2 \times 10^{-16}$
at 90\% CL. 
One of the parameters characterizing the sensitivity of an experiment to a process of interest is its
single event sensitivity (SES), defined as:
\begin{equation}
    SES \equiv \frac{1}{N_{POT} \cdot P_{\mu \ stop} \cdot \epsilon_{CE} \cdot BR_{capture}}
\end{equation} 
$N_{POT}$ means the number of protons on target in the experiment, $P_{\mu \ stop}$ is the number of muons stopped on target per proton, $\epsilon_{CE}$ is the Conversion Electron acceptance, which is a product of detector efficiency (dependent on the momentum signal region) and fraction of muons interacting in the live time window and $BR_{capture}$ is the branching ratio of muon captures, which is 60.9\%. The optimized Mu2e signal window corresponds to a SES of $2.4 \times 10^{-16}$. The background estimates after the sensitivity optimization are summarized in Table \ref{tab:summarybkg}, resulting in a total background of approximately $\sim$ 0.1 event/year. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity} shows the momentum and time distributions for CE signal and background processes corresponding to the optimized signal window for Run I. A detailed analysis and estimate of the Mu2e expected backgrounds for Run I can be found in Ref. \cite{universe9010054}.

\section{Experimental setup}\label{setup}
Figure \ref{fig:mu2escheme} shows a schematic overview of the Mu2e experiment, illustrating the trajectory of the pulsed proton beam directed towards the production target indicated by the red arrow. The experiment uses a solenoid system to generate magnetic fields essential for its operations. The Production Solenoid (PS) surrounds the production target, while further downstream, the Transport Solenoid (TS) provides the magnetic field for the muon beamline. The TS, configured in an S-shape, incorporates collimators and proton absorbers strategically positioned to minimize experimental backgrounds. The ST is located at the beginning of the Detector Solenoid (DS). Proton absorbers surround the ST, not shown in the figure. The tracker and the calorimeter are housed in the DS, enabling momentum and energy measurements, respectively. 
Additionally, a Stopping Target Monitor (STM) positioned downstream at the DS's end, not shown, monitors the ST's condition and estimates the captured muon count. Not shown in the figure is the Mu2e Cosmic Ray Veto (CRV) system: it surrounds the DS and half of the TS. In next sections, a more detailed description of systems of the Mu2e experiment will be given.

\section{Accelerator system and Proton Beam}\label{accel}
\subsection{Pulsed Proton Beam}\label{pulsedprotonbeam}
As previously discussed in Section  \ref{backgrounds}, the Mu2e experiment uses a pulsed proton beam to reduce background from prompt processes, as pion capture. The 8 GeV, 8 kW beam originates from the Fermilab Booster, Ref. \cite{PhysRevAccelBeams.20.111003}. A pulsed beam with a 1695 ns gap between two pulses is needed. Figure \ref{fig:accell} illustrates the Fermilab accelerator facilities involved in generating and delivering the pulsed proton beam. The Fermilab Booster delivers 8 GeV protons in 20 batches throughout a 1.4 s Main Injector cycle at 15 Hz, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:deliver}. Thus, the accelerator timeline is described using a fundamental time unit of 1 tick that corresponds to 66.7 ms.

The two Mu2e batches, represented by the two blue bars at ticks 1 and 2, are injected into the Recycler Ring, each containing $4 \times 10^{12}$ protons. The protons from these batches are reorganized within the Recycler using a 2.5 MHz radio frequency (RF) system into 8 bunches. These bunches are then extracted individually from the Recycler and transported to the Delivery Ring every 48.1 ms, as shown in the middle part of Figure \ref{fig:deliver}. Once inside the Delivery Ring, a single bunch of $1 \times 10^{12}$ protons undergoes gradual extraction. This process results in the extraction of a small fraction of the bunch per revolution, delivered to the Mu2e experiment. The complete bunch is extracted over a span of 43.1 ms, across $\sim$25000 turns around the Delivery Ring, as shown in the bottom part of Figure \ref{fig:deliver}.

\label{fig:beamprofile}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:beamprofile} illustrates the temporal profile of the beam at the Mu2e Proton Target. Consecutive proton pulses are spaced by 1695 ns. Each pulse lasts for 250 ns and contains $(3.9 \pm 2.0 )\times 10^7$ protons. The 1695 ns pulse separation is highly advantageous for the Mu2e experiment. Figure \ref{fig:beamwindow} shows the beam pulse, 
the simulated pion flux, the muon capture rate on the ST and the muon decay rate. The active window for detecting Conversion Electrons begins at $\sim$640 ns and extends for more or less 1 $\mu$s. This selection finds a compromise between reducing pion-induced backgrounds  and increasing the rate of muon decays. Because of the brief lifetime of the pions, they are gone by the time the active window opens, resulting in a suppression of the pion count by $\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$. The 1695 ns pulse separation exceeds twice the muon lifetime, allowing sufficient temporal separation between prompt backgrounds and the live window without excessively compromising beam intensity.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Proton Beam Extinction and Extinction Monitor}
As mentioned in the previous section, the Mu2e experiment requires the extinction level of the incoming proton beam, to reduce backgrounds caused by out-of-time protons. 
The extinction rate, defined as the ratio between the number of out-of-time protons and the number of the in-time protons, should be lower than $10^{-10}$, 
Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}. The structure of the beam leads to an extinction level $2.1 \times 10^{-5}$. To take into account the fact that some beam will 
leak out of two consecutive proton pulses, an Extinction Insert is deployed in the M4 beamline between the Delivery Ring and the Mu2e experiment. The out-of-time 
beam particles are swept into a collimator system by a set of oscillating dipoles, called AC dipoles. These AC dipoles are simulated to offer an additional 
extinction factor of $5\times 10^{-8}$, reducing the overall extinction to $1.1 \times 10^{-12}$, leaving a margin of 10$^2$, Ref. \cite{accelerator}. An 
Extinction Monitor is positioned downstream of the production target along the proton beamline, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:extintion}. It monitors the 
extinction level of the incoming beam striking the Mu2e production target and delivers a measurement at a precision better than $10^{-10}$. The Extinction 
Monitor consists of a collimator and magnetic filter system, a pixel telescope, a system of trigger scintillators and a range-stack. The collimator and 
magnetic filtter system transport a small quantity of the particles generated at the production target to the Extinction Monitor. The pixel telescope 
tracks the trajectory of charged particles coming from the collimator. The pixel telescope consists of a permanent magnet and 8 scintillators, as shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:extintionmonitor}. The system uses a permanent magnet to separate two sets of four scintillator planes, allowing for momentum measurements 
of entering particles. The range stack is located further downstream from the pixel telescope. Steel absorber plates separate scintillators, distinguishing 
between hadrons and muons based on their penetrating capacity.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Production Target}
The Mu2e production target (PT) is an additional essential element of the 
accelerator systems. It is made of tungsten. 
The tungsten has a high pion production cross-section, 
capable of producing the necessary number of stopped muons. 
This material was also chosen because it is the metal with the highest
melting point (3422 °C) and with an excellent resistance to deformation and corrosion.

It is suspended in the middle of the PS bore, Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}.
The tungsten core is embedded in a \textit{bicycle whell} frame, 
suspended by spoke at the center. The current design of the PT, shown in Figure \ref{fig:PT}, 
has circular rings at the end and its core is segmented to allow a better temperature 
dissipation. This design is expected to resist more than one year and it has a muon yield
of 0.0016 $\mu$/proton, Ref.\cite{PT}.

\section{Solenoids System}
The Mu2e Solenoid system consists of three magnetically coupled systems: 
the \textbf{Production Solenoid} (PS), the \textbf{Transport Solenoid} (TS) 
and the \textbf{Detector Solenoid} (DS), shown in Figure \ref{fig:mu2escheme}. 
Each system contains multiple detectors and each one is made of superconducting 
coils wound with aluminum stabilized Nb-Ti Rutherford cables, located in a 4.5 m 
long cryostat. The shape of solenoids is designed to efficiently transmit muons 
and to suppress other particles. The resulting magnetic field is $\mathcal{O}$(1 T): 
its highest value is 4.6 T at the upstream end of the experiment and the lowest value 
is 1 T at the downstream end. 
The muons are guided toward the ST and the DS by lowering the magnetic field. 
Local magnetic field minima are avoided to avoid trapping particles in these areas. 
In the PS, the magnetic field decreases from 4.6 T to 2.5 T at the entrance of 
the TS. The large gradient helps to collect the secondary pions and muons and to 
direct them towards the DS. The magnetic field across the S-shaped TS changes its 
value only by a factor of 0.5 T. The shape of the TS allows to not transmit photons 
and other neutral particles in the DS and its dimension was set to avoid transmitting 
particles with large momentum. These particles either spiral with a large helical 
radius (large initial momenta perpendicular to the field) or cannot create an 
S-shaped bend (large initial momenta parallel to the magnetic field), resulting 
in collisions with solenoid walls or collimators. As particle drifts in the solenoid,  
the field dependends on the particle charge, positively and negatively charged muons 
drift in opposite vertical directions and are separated, as explained in Appendix 
\ref{appendix1}. In the upstream curved solenoid portion, as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:collimators}, the spiraling positive (blue) and negative (red) muons 
are deflected downwards and upwards respectively. Positive muons are stopped in 
collimators COL3u and COL3d. The TS is long enough for pion decay, suppressing 
RPC backgrounds. It also protects the detectors from radioactively hot areas around 
the primary beam and the production target. The magnetic field in the first half of 
the DS is reduced from 2 T to 1 T. In a smoothly gradient field, the adiabatic 
invariance of the magnetic flux can be used. Assuming a constant $p^2_\perp/B$, there is:
\begin{equation}
    v^2_{\parallel}=v^2_0-v^2_{\perp 0}\frac{B(z)}{B_0}
\end{equation}
Here, $\perp$ is referred with respect to the magnetic field $B$ and $\parallel$ is 
referred to the $z$ direction. The subscript 0's indicates the initial state. 
The gradient pitches electrons forward into the tracker's acceptance while 
rejecting higher velocity electron, as mentioned in \ref{beamelectrons}. 
The second half of the DS containing the tracker and the calorimeter has a 
uniform magnetic field of 1 T. This allows particle trajectories and momenta 
to be reliably measured.

\label{fig:muonbeamline}
\end{figure}


\subsection{The Production Solenoid}
The Production Solenoid (PS), shown in Figure \ref{fig:PS}, collects pions, 
kaons generated by the interactions between the 8 GeV proton beam and the production target. 
The magnetic field gradient allows to collect also part of the particles 
emitted along the proton beam direction, improving the stopped muon yield.
It is 4 m long and is composed of NbTi superconducting cables stabilised with
Aluminum and cooled by liquid helium. To avoid damages to the superconducting cables and
to the cooling system a bronze Heat and Radiation shield is built inside the solenoid.
The magnetic field is 4.6 T at the end of the PS and decreases almost linearly to 2.5 T at the
junction with the TS.

    The production target is placed approximately at the center of the superconducting coils.}
    \label{fig:PS}
    \end{figure}
\subsection{The Transport Solenoid}
The S-shaped transport solenoid is composed of a series of wide aperture superconducting
solenoid rings. It also contains a set of collimators and absorbers to provide charge and 
momentum selection and reduce the flux of antiprotons.
A thin window assembly is installed at the 
beginning of the TS and also between the rotatable collimators to absorb antiprotons in 
the beam. 

It is divided in five parts. 

The first one is called TS1 that contains the first collimator (COL1), 
Figure \ref{fig:collimatorsshape}, made of copper wedges. 
It filters particles from their momentum and reduces the radiation damage for coils of the 
upstream part of the TS (TSu). 

The TS2 contains a toroidal field in order to create a 
vertical displacement of the charged particles,
according to their charge and momentum.
Neutral particles, that are not sensitive to the magnetic 
field are not transported to the next section.

In TS3, negative muons are selected with two rotatable collimators (COL3u and COL3d, 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:collimatorsshape}). 
The rotatable feature allows selection of $\mu^-$'s instead of $\mu^+$'s, which can 
be used for detector calibration. 

The TS4 is the second toroid section of the TS and its role is 
to collimate the beams on the TS axis.

TS5 connects TS with DS and it contains a collimator (COL5), 
Figure \ref{fig:collimatorsshape}, made of polyethylene, 
which will serve as a shield from neutrons. It is linked to the Detector 
Solenoid and matches its field to provide the best beam transmission.

        and COL5.}
        \label{fig:collimatorsshape}
        \end{figure}

\subsection{The Detector Solenoid}
The DS, shown in Figure \ref{fig:DS}, is a cylindrical system of approximately 11 m in 
length and 2 m in radius, which houses the Stopping Target, 
the proton absorber, the tracker and the calorimeter. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.8\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240306_225639.png}
    \caption[The structure of the Detector Solenoid coils and cryostat.]{Overall structure of the Detector Solenoid coils and cryostat, Ref. \cite{bobbb}.}
    \label{fig:DS}
    \end{figure}
The system is divided into two sections: a 4 m gradient section following the TS, 
where the magnetic field decreases linearly from 2 T to 1 T, and a 6 
m spectrometer section. 

The gradient region drive the Conversion Electron 
inside the tracker acceptance, while the low momentum particles 
are driven to the low radius region that is not covered by detectors.  

In the spectrometer region, the uniform magnetic field allows a precise 
measurement of the particle momentum. 

The DS is straight, differently from the COMET experiment. This allows 
to detect both $e^+$ and $e^-$, with the disadvantage that the detectors are exposed to the 
beam flash and to protons and neutrons produced by the muon
nuclear capture in the Stopping Target.

A collection of absorbing materials is placed inside the DS, shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:absorbersDS}, to suppress 
the rate of protons and neutrons that can generate spare hits in the 
tracker or in the Cosmic Ray Veto:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transport Solenoid Downstream Absorber (TSdA)}: This 
    polyethylene disk-shaped absorber is designed to shield against neutron radiation. 
    Simulations predict it will reduce the hit rate in the calorimeter by approximately 30\% 
    while having a minimal impact (around 0.2\%) on electron acceptance.
    \item \textbf{Inner Proton Absorber (IPA)}: This is a thin (0.5 mm) conical 
    frustum made of low $Z$-material. It aims to reduce the rate of protons produced 
    in muon nuclear capture (around 0.03 per captured muon) while minimizing the 
    energy loss of Conversion Electrons.
    \item \textbf{Outer Proton Absorber (OPA)}: Another conical frustum with a 
    thickness of 20 mm, serving the same purpose as the IPA.
\end{itemize}


Finally, the IFB is a plate 
at the end of the DS, maintaining the DS vacuum and providing a path for the services and 
signals between vacuum and hall air.

    \label{fig:absorbersDS}
    \end{figure}




\section{Stopping target}
The Mu2e muon ST, Figure \ref{fig:ST}, is 
composed of 37 annular aluminum foils  of 75 mm of radius with a purity of 
above 99.99\%, Ref. \cite{bobbb}. The foils are 100 $\mu$m thick, 
minimizing energy losses of the Conversion Electrons. This design 
narrows the reconstructed Conversion Electron momentum distribution 
and separates it from the DIO electron momentum distribution. 
The disks have an internal hole of 21 mm of radius.
The annular design reduces interactions with the beam electrons and 
other particle released in muon nuclear captures, which can create 
particle sprays and damage to the tracker's internal components. 
The central hole does not affect the target capacity to halt muons, 
which move in helical patterns. The space between each disk is
22.2 mm, bringing the total lenght of the Stopping target to $\sim$80 cm.
Muons passing through the hole of an upstream foil will stop in a downstream layer. 
The design of the Stopping Target has been chosen by considering two 
conflicting physical requirements. Firstly, the target must be thick enough 
to stop a significant fraction of the muons, with the current version achieving 
an indicative stopping fraction of 40\%. Secondly, the target must be thin 
enough to control the energy loss of the Conversion Electrons, which is why 
the target has a segmented geometry.
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.5\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240706_122723.png}
    \caption[The Stopping Target design.]{The Stopping Target design. 
    Each disk is supported by three cables not shown in the picture }
    \label{fig:ST}
\end{figure}

There are various factors to consider while selecting aluminum as the ST material. 
First, as described in Section \ref{backgrounds}, the aluminum 
target has a low RMC background. Moreover, the muonic aluminium 
atom has a quite long lifetime, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:muonicatom}. 
The long lifetime allows separation between prompt backgrounds and a 
live window with a good decay rate. The muon DIO endpoint energy, 
further, depends on the type of nucleus, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:endpoint}. 
Aluminum has a high endpoint energy, so when muons are captured on other 
detector materials with a higher atomic number $Z$, they have lower 
endpoint energies and do not contribute to background. Aluminum is a 
suitable ST material for muon-to-electron conversion searches.
Moreover, the branching ratio ($BR$) of the conversion varies 
depending on the ST material due to differences in atomic number 
($Z$) and mass number ($A$). By comparing $BR$s on different nuclei 
normalized to aluminum, it's possible to identify the dominating 
operator type, such as scalar ($S$), dipole ($D$), vector of 
transition charge radius type and vector of effective $Z$-penguin type, 
($V(\gamma)$) and ($V(Z)$) respectively. 
Despite challenges in separating prompt backgrounds from 
signals due to short lifetimes of muonic atoms, 
materials with higher $Z$ offer better model differentiation. 
If the Mu2e experiment observes conversion signals, a subsequent search 
could make use of Titanium as the ST. A more detailed discussion can be 
found in Ref. \cite{PhysRevD.80.013002}, \cite{PhysRevD.76.059902} and 
\cite{abusalma2018expression}.

\section{The Mu2e detectors}
\subsection{The straw tracker}\label{trackersec}
The Mu2e straw tracker is placed inside the Detector Solenoid downstream from 
the ST in a 1 T uniform magnetic field. The tracker is one of the most 
important Mu2e detectors: it must provide very good momentum resolution to 
disentangle the monochromatic CE signal from the background. 
Since the shape of the DIO spectrum near the endpoint decreases as 
$(E_{\mu e} -E_e)^5$, the impact of this background source can be significantly 
enhanced if the momentum resolution for some reason is reduced. 
To achieve the desired DIO suppression, the required momentum resolution should be below 1 MeV/c.  
Figure \ref{fig:trkres} shows the expected momentum resolution as determined 
from a full GEANT4 simulation of the detector, Front-End electronics, and DAQ.
It is fundamental to have a thorough understanding of the tails of the momentum resolution. 
The right tail could push low-energy DIO electrons into the Conversion Electron signal window. 
On the other hand, the left tail, which is primarily due to energy losses in the Stopping Target, 
in the Inner Proton Absorber, in the Outer Proton Absorber, and in the tracker itself, could 
push Conversion Electrons below the signal window in the region dominated by DIOs 
thus resulting in a signal efficiency reduction.
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.5\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240330_104830.png}
    \caption[The momentum resolution of the straw-tracker.]{Momentum resolution of the straw-tracker as determined for 
    a sample of Monte Carlo Conversion Electrons, Ref. \cite{bobbb}.}
    \label{fig:trkres}
    \end{figure} 
To minimise the probability of scattering and the energy loss of the CE, 
the volume inside the Detector Solenoid is evacuated to $10^{-4}$ Torr 
and the tracker has been designed to minimise the material component. 
The Mu2e Collaboration selected the straw-tube technology for a detector 
designed to have a complex geometry, Ref. \cite{bobbb}.

Figure \ref{fig:sttrk} shows a schematic representation of the 
transverse view of the straw-tracker. 
The detector has an annular shape with an active region covered by straws only between the 
internal radius of 380 mm and the external radius of 700 mm. 
The internal volume is not instrumented. A similar choice 
was made also for the design of the electromagnetic calorimeter, Section \ref{calorimeter}. 

This peculiar geometry allows to significantly reduce the level of background in the detector, 
which was made intentionally blind to low-energy particles, since in a homogeneous magnetic field, 
charged particles follow an helical trajectory with a radius proportional to the transverse momentum
(eq. \ref{partincamp}).
Figure \ref{fig:sttrk} also shows three example electron trajectories corresponding 
to particles with different transverse momentum. A low momentum electron, 
represented by the blue circle, will not intercept and will not generate 
background hits in the detector; higher momentum electrons, the orange circle, 
will intercept the inner part of the detector but will not necessarily generate a 
sufficient number of hits to reconstruct a track; electrons with momentum approximately 
above 90 MeV/c, the green circle, are expected to be reconstructed. 
The simulation shows that the majority of tracks reconstructed in the tracker will be DIOs. 
The choice of this peculiar geometry simplified also the design of the detector 
Front-End electronics and data acquisition systems, since it significantly reduced the amount of 
data to be readout, acquired and processed. This simplified also offline pattern 
recognition and track reconstruction, by reducing the amount of background hits.

Chapter \ref{chaptertrk} will provide a more detailed description of the entire detector, 
including the mechanical structure, the Front-End electronics and 
DAQ system.
\subsubsection{Momentum scale calibration}
One of the most challenging aspects of the Mu2e experiment is achieving the 
required momentum resolution to distinguish the CE electron from the background.

Mu2e requires at least one source of high-energy calibration electrons or 
positrons to independently measure the absolute momentum scale of the tracker. 
The momentum scale calibration relies on accurately reconstructing the 
$\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$ peak, with its success critically dependent on the 
suppression of $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu$ decays in flight (DIF). 
Several approaches have been explored, with the most promising ones being:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Special run with adjusted TS collimators: operating with 
    reversed TS collimators and a reduced DS field 
    (70\% of the nominal value), this setup is designed to capture the 
    leptonic decay ($\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$) of stopping $\pi^+$ in the nominal Stopping Target;
    
    \item Low intensity run with reduced DS magnetic field: 
    running at low intensity and a further reduced DS field (50\% of the nominal value), 
    this approach aims to gather high-statistics data to accurately fit 
    the Michel edge of the DIO momentum distribution.
\end{enumerate}

Several important considerations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Early time measurement: to effectively 
    reconstruct the peak in the momentum distribution 
    of positrons from $\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$ decays, 
    measurements must be performed at early times, approximately 
    $T \sim 300$ ns. This necessitates operating at a reduced proton 
    beam intensity to mitigate pileup concerns;
    
    \item Special instrumentation requirement: to minimize 
    background from muon decays in flight, the calibration demands 
    the installation of a beam degrader in the DS.
\end{itemize}

The momentum scale calibration described involves two key measurements: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The edge of the positron momentum spectrum from $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu$ decays at $B = 0.5$ T;
    \item The $\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$ peak at $B = 0.7$ T.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these measurements determines the momentum scale at their respective 
magnetic field values. By combining these measurements, we can extrapolate the 
momentum scale to the nominal magnetic field, $B = 1.0$ T. This concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:momscale}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240707_180742.png}
\caption[The momentum calibration scheme.]{Illustration of the momentum calibration scheme.}
\label{fig:momscale}
\end{figure}

The calibration scheme assumes that the magnetic field is initially set based 
on readings from an NMR probe, and any necessary scale corrections can be 
effectively managed by rescaling the value of the nominal magnetic field.
\subsection{The electromagnetic calorimeter}\label{calorimeter}
The Mu2e electromagnetic calorimeter serves multiple purposes, Ref. \cite{em4}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the measurement of the energy deposited in the calorimeter 
    allows to separate electrons and muons of the same momentum. 
    The energy-to-momentum ratio($E/p$) will be used for particle 
    identification and to suppress the background due to cosmic-ray muons;
    \item the calorimeter signals allow to improve pattern recognition and 
    the quality of track reconstrution: calorimeter clusters can be used 
    for consistency check and to reduce track reconstruction 
    errors due to background hits in the straw tracker;
    \item it provides independent triggers from the track-based triggers, Ref. \cite{em6}. 
\end{itemize} 
To accomplish these tasks, the calorimeter needs to fulfill 
the following physical requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item an energy resolution better than $\sigma_E/E \sim$10\% allows
     to reach a rejection factor at the level of 200 between Conversion Electron
    and the $\sim$ 40 MeV energy deposit from 105 MeV/c cosmic ray muons mimicking the signal;
    \item a timing resolution better than 500 ps ensures that
    the energy depositions in the calorimeter are in time with

\end{itemize}


The calorimeter disks are being assembled at Fermilab's SiDet facility, as shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:calostatus}. The components will be described in the next sections.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The calorimeter mechanical structure}
The calorimeter is located in the DS downstream of the tracker (Figure \ref{fig:DS})
It consists of two annular disks, with an internal radius of 35 cm and 
an external radius of 66 cm, positioned at a relative distance of 70 cm (Figure \ref{fig:calo1}).
The separation was chosen to match half of the distance between two periods of the helical trajectory 
of a typical 105 MeV Conversion Electron. This maximises the detection probability of conversion 
electrons: electrons which pass through the hole of the first disk will be detector by the second one, Ref. \cite{em7}. 


The calorimeter mechanical structure was designed to support the layout of the crystals 
by piling them up in a self-standing array organized in consecutive staggered rows. 
Each crystal array is supported by two coaxial cylinders. The inner cylinder must be 
as thin and light as possible in order to minimize the passive material in the 
region where spiraling background electrons are concentrated. The outer cylinder 
is as robust as required to support the load of the crystals (700 kg). Each disk 
has two cover plates. The plate facing the beam is made of carbon fiber to minimize 
the degradation of the electron energy, while the back plate should also be robust 
to support the SiPMs, the Front-End electronics and the SiPM cooling lines and it 
is therefore made of Polyether ether ketone (PEEK). The crystal arrangement is 
self-supporting, with the load carried primarily by the outer ring. 
The heat generated by SiPMs, Front-End electronics and read out electronics 
must be removed within temperature values acceptable for the correct operation 
of each device. Furthermore, the difficult access to components requires a 
cooling system free of fault and maintenance needs for at least one year. 
The cooling system has to maintain SiPM temperature at approximately -10°C to 
minimize the dark current: this is obtained by circulating a refrigerating fluid at approximately  -15°C.

    \label{fig:calo1}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{The undoped Cesium Iodide crystals}
Each calorimeter disk is filled with 674 undoped cesium 
iodide (CsI) crystals, Ref. \cite{em6}, wrapped in a 150 $\mu$m foil fo Tyvek. 
Undoped CsI represents the best compromise between cost, 
reliability, performance and radiation hardness, providing 
a fast emission time and a sufficiently high light yield. Pure 
CsI has a wavelength peak emission at 310 nm and a scintillation 
time of 20 ns and a light yield of about 2000 photons/MeV. 
Figure \ref{fig:calo2} (top right) shows some CsI crystals: 
the dimensions are 34$\times$34 200 mm$^3$. The crystal length 
is approximately 10$X_0$ which is sufficient to contain the 105 
MeV Conversion Electron shower since the average incident angle 
is 50°. Undoped CsI crystals also have a radiation hardness 
adequate for the Mu2e operational conditions.

    SiPM arrays and two Front-End boards mounted on the copper holder (right), Ref. \cite{em4}.}
    \label{fig:calo2}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{The calorimeter readout chain}
The readout of the calorimeter is performed through a chain of components: Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM), 
Front-End electronics, Mezzanine board and Digitizer board. In the following, 
a brief description of each component will be provided.
\paragraph{Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM)}
Since the calorimeter will operate in a 1 T magnetic field, SiPMs were chosen over PMTs (Figure \ref{fig:sipmcell}), Ref. \cite{em1}. 
To well match the scintillation emission of 310 nm to the SiPM photon detection efficiency, 
UV extended Hamamatsu SiPMs with a front window made of a silicon resin were selected. Each SiPM is composed of a
2 $\times$ 3 array array of individual 6 mm $\times$ 6 mm cells.
The array can be seen as the parallel of two series of 3 cells, that 
are powered by the same source. The mixed configuration is motivated by 
two competing requirements: a parallel connection has greater capacitance, 
resulting in a lower response time but requiring a lower bias voltage, whereas 
a series connection has the opposite characteristics. 
To improve reliability, light collection efficiency and resolution, each single 
crystal is readout by two custom SiPMs arrays
Magnetic field resistance was the factor in choosing between SiPMs and PMTs.
The good efficiency of the SiPMs allows to collect approximately 20 p.e./MeV per SiPM.
To operate in vacuum, minimise outgassing contributions, reduce 
thermal coupling between crystals and Front-End electronics, the crystal-SiPM 
coupling is done without any optical grease and a 2 mm air gap is mantained 
between the crystal and the readout sensor.

Since the main scintillation component has a wavelength of 315 nm to match the SiPM
photon detection efficiency as a function of wavelength, each crystal is coupled with a readout 
module consisting of two ultraviolet (UV)-extended SiPM arrays
and the corresponding analog Front-End electronics (FEE) boards, as illustrated in Figure 
\ref{fig:calo2} (bottom right), Ref. \cite{em5}, \cite{em2} and \cite{em3}. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:calo3}, each board is positioned within the electronic 
crates that sorround the calorimeter disks.

        panel plate. Bottom right: the Mezzanine and DiRAC boards, Ref. \cite{em4}.}

    \caption[The design of SiPM cells.]{The design of a 2$\times$3 array of SiPM cells.}
    \label{fig:sipmcell}
\end{figure}
\paragraph{The Front-End eletronics}
Each SiPM is read by one Front-End board directly linked to the pins on the 
back of the SiPMs and, via cable, to the Mezzanine board (Figure \ref{fig:connectiontomezzanine}). 
The Front-End board provides signal preamplification and shaping, local linear 
regulation of the SiPM bias voltage, and monitoring of the SiPM current and temperature. 
The two Front-End boards connected to the two SiPMs reading the same CsI 
crystal are housed in a copper holder (Figure \ref{fig:holder}), which 
serves as a mechanical support and ensures SiPM cooling. 
An enternal Faraday cage reduces noise. The holder also holds 
an optical fiber used to pulse the crystal with laser light to 
calibrate energy and time response.

    \label{fig:calooo}
  \end{figure}


\paragraph{The Mezzanine board}
The Mezzanine Board serves as the interface between 20 different 
Front-End boards and one Digitizer (Figure \ref{fig:mezzanine}) 
he Mezzanine sets all FEE parameters (such as High Voltage (HV)) and 
monitors all Front-End boards and SiPM parameters (such as HV, temperature, and current). 
It also provides low voltage to the Front-End boards. The HV of each SiPM can be 
independently set. These tasks are performed by an ARM processor located on the 
Mezzanine board. The cables chosen to link the Front-End boards to the 
Mezzanine board must be radiation-resistant, shielded, and have low outgassing properties.

    Right: The Cable linking 4 FEEs to one Mezzanine.}
    \label{fig:mezzanine}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{The digitizer Board}
The Digitizer Readout Controller (DiRAC) digitizes the SiPM 
signals received from the Mezzanine Board and manages data 
transmission to the experiment's DAQ system. Zero suppressed 
data are sent from the DiRAC board to the DAQ via optical fibers. 
A sampling rate of 200 MHz (one sample every 5 ns) and a 12-bit resolution 
satisfy the calorimeter requirements. The Two SiPMs which read the same 
crystal are always connected to different DiRAC boards hosted in separate 
crates to prevent the complete loss of any crystals in the event of a single crate fault.

\paragraph{The crate}
The Mezzanine and DiRAC boards are collected in crates. Each crate contains up to eight Mezzanine 
and DiRAC boards. Each crate provides a cooling system for the Mezzanine and DiRAC boards by 
exploiting a network on cooling lines grooved in the crate walls. The thermal contact between 
the electronics components on the Mezzanine and the DIRAC and the crate walls is ensured by a 
copper plate covering the entire board.
\subsubsection{Module-0 prototype}
To validate the chosen design before commencing mass production of 
the calorimeter components, a large-scale prototype was constructed and 
tested with an electron beam at the Beam Test Facility of the National 
Laboratories of Frascati. The Module-0 consisted of 52 undoped CsI crystals, 
read by 102 SiPMs connected to FEE boards. Its mechanics was designed 
to closely resemble the final calorimeter, allowing for the testing 
of assembly procedures and cooling.
The energy and time resolution are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:calores}, Ref. \cite{bobbb} and \cite{calo95}.

\end{figure}
\subsection{The Cosmic Ray Veto}\label{CRV}
As reported in the Section \ref{backgrounds}, Mu2e expects a level of background due to cosmic rays at a rate of one event per day. 
To minimize the source of these backgrounds, Mu2e exploits a combination of shielding and an active 
veto system named Cosmic Ray Veto (CRV). Figure \ref{fig:crv} shows a 
schematic representation of 
the CRV covering the region of the Detector Solenoid and half of the Transport Solenoid 
almost entirely (there is no veto on the floor at the bottom), for a total detector area of about 327 m$^2$.
The CRV modules are manufactured from plastic scintillator extrusions. 
In the different regions of the detector the extrusions may have different lenghts, 
but they all have the same cross-sectional area of $5 \times 2$ cm$^2$, with different lengths. The extrusions 
are coated with Titanium dioxide to improve internal reflections and thus, the light yield. 
Two grooves are extruded inside the scintillator bar throughout its length to contain two 
1.4 mm diameter wavelength shifting fibers. The fibers transport light to the extrusion 
ends where each fibre is instrumented with a $2 \times 2$ mm$^2$ SiPM at each end. Figure \ref{fig:crvmodule} 
shows the cross-section of a CRV module. Each module is made of four overlapping staggered layers 
of plastic scintillator counters to reduce the effects of gaps. The layers are separated by 10 mm aluminium plates used as absorbers. 
When three of the four layers of the CRV are activated, a veto window of $\pm$125 ns is opened. 
A conversion-like event observed during this time window is assumed to be produced by a cosmic-ray muon and is disregarded. 
The estimated total dead time is $\sim$5\%. 
The success of the experiment depends on a detection effectiveness of 99.99\% or higher, as the simulation show.

(CRV-D), and the hole where the Transport Solenoid enters the enclosure (TS-hole), Ref. \cite{bartoszek2015mu2e}.}

\end{figure}
\subsection{The Stopping Target Monitor}
A Muon Beam Stop (MBS) is installed at the downstream end of the DS to 
absorb muons that are not stopped in the Stopping Target, shown in Figure \ref{fig:stm}. 
The MBS has been designed to limit the effects of muon decays and captures. 
The magnetic field gradient prevents the majority of the low-energy charged 
particles created in the MBS from moving upstream towards the detectors.  
The MBS is made of high-$Z$ minerals and polyethylene. Muons have an extremely short lifetime in 
high-$Z$ materials, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:muonicatom}, which minimizes the effects of muon 
decays and captures much earlier than the Mu2e live window starting at 640 ns. Moreover, polyethylene 
absorbs protons and neutrons emitted by the excited nuclei during muon captures.  

The Stopping Target Monitor (STM) is placed downstream from the MBS, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:stm}, 
to measure the number of muons stopped on the ST which will be used as the denominator of $R_{\mu e}$ (eq. \ref{rmue}).
\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width =0.7\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240306_180910.png}
    \caption[The Stopping Target Monitor geometry.]{The Stopping Target Monitor geometry showing the DS region (left),

    \label{fig:stm}
    \end{figure}
    The STM measurement technique exploits the 347 keV X-ray line produced in the 2p$\rightarrow$1s 
    radiative transition of the muon moving to the ground state in the muonic atom (Figure \ref{fig:stmprocess}), 
    which is present for 80\% of the stopped muons. Although the 2p$\rightarrow$1s transition has the 
    largest yield, there are also additional X-ray transitions with substantial yields, 
    including 3p$\rightarrow$1s and 4p$\rightarrow$1s. In addition, the 3d$\rightarrow$2p 
    transition that populates the 2p state appears in the energy spectrum.

    An alternative option is to measure gamma rays associated to muons interactions in the Stopping Target (Figure \ref{fig:stmprocess}).
    These are unambiguous signals that muons stopped in the aluminum target. 
    The main signatures are the following ones: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 1809 keV gamma-ray that is emitted in the nuclear capture chain:
    \begin{equation}
        \mu^- \ + \ ^{27}\text{Al} \ \rightarrow \ ^{26}\text{Mg}^* \ + \ \nu_\mu \quad \quad ^{26}\text{Mg}^* \ \rightarrow ^{26}\text{Mg} \ + \ \gamma(1809 \ \text{keV})
     \end{equation}
     The $^{26}\text{Mg}^*$ mean de-excitation time is negligible (476 fs) with 
     respect to the muonic atom lifetime (864 ns). 
     This process occurs for 51\% of the nuclear captures.
     \item  A 844 KeV gamma-ray coming from the decay of 
     long-lived ($\tau \sim$9.5 m) isotopes produced in muon nuclear captures:
     \begin{equation}
        ^{27}\text{Mg} \ \rightarrow \ ^{27}\text{Al} \ + \ \gamma(844 \ \text{keV}) \ + \ e^- \ + \ \bar{\nu}_e
     \end{equation}
     This process occurs for the 9.2\% of nuclear captures.
\end{itemize}

    \end{figure}

    The Mu2e Stopping Target Monitor has been designed to determine the number of 
    muons in the Stopping Target to within 10\% precision over the course of the experiment.  
    It is made of two solid state High Purity Germanium (HPGe) crystal detectors and one 
    scintillating lanthanum Bromide (LaBr$_3$) detectors. The HPGe detectors have an 
    energy resolution (FWHM) of 2.5 keV in an energy range of 300-2000 keV and are used 
    to measure photons produced by the secondary muonic aluminium orbital transitions 
    (347 keV) and nuclear captures (884 keV). The LaBr$_3$ detector has one order of 
    magnitude worse energy resolution than the HPGe detector, but it provides a much 
    higher rate capability. It is used to measure photons produced in the nuclear captures 
    (1809 keV) emitted in time with the nuclear captures.
