\section{tracker hit}
Each Tracker hit comprises some geographical information to uniquely identify
the straw, the time of the pulses of the two end of the straw from the start of the
Î¼spill, the time over threshold (TOT) for the two pulses and a variable number
of 12 bit ADC samples for the sum of the two pulses. This data is passed via 4
SERDES lanes using 10 to 8 bit encoding, hence the natural width of the incoming
data is 32 bits. We assume that only 16 of the 32 bits are used in the following
and refer to this as DIGI word. The proposed definition of data received from the
DIGI FPGAs is in table 4.4.
