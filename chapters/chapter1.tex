\chapter{Charged Lepton Flavour Violation}\label{intr}
\textit{This Chapter offers a concise overview of the fundamental 
theoretical and experimental components essential to understand the objectives 
of the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab and the work conducted for this 
Thesis. The introduction to the Standard Model and certain extensions serves to 
justify the investigation of Charged Lepton Flavour Violation (CLFV), 
since it would be a clear signal of new physics beyond the current theories. 
Fundamental bibliography for this Chapter can be found in \cite{Bernstein_2013} and \cite{clfv_signorelli}.}
\section{Theoretical introduction}
\subsection{The Standard Model}
The Standard Model (SM) provides an excellent description of elementary particles and their interactions.
It describes three out of 
four fundamental interactions known to this day: electromagnetism,
weak and strong interaction\add{s}.
The SM is 
based on the gauge symmetry group $U(1)_Y \times SU(2)_L \times SU(3)_C$. The 
first two terms describe the electroweak interaction, $Y$ indicates 
the hypercharge and $L$ refers to the fact that this acts only on the left handed components of the fields.
The last term describes the strong interaction, and $C$ indicates the color charge.
The SM describes the elementary fields shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sm}.

\subsubsection{Bosons}\label{bosons}
A boson is a particle with zero or integer spin, which follows Bose-Einstein statistics.
There are twelve fundamental bosons, that mediate interactions: $\gamma$, $Z$, $W^{\pm}$
for the electroweak interaction and eight gluons mediating the strong interaction.
The Higgs field is a complex scalar weak isospin doublet that is 
responsible for the mechanism through which fermions and
bosons acquire mass and also explains the origin of $U (1)_{EM}$ 
through the spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the $SU (2)_L \times SU (1)_Y$ in the 
electroweak sector. Also mesons, that are composed of a quark 
and antiquark pair, are bosons. Bosons can be either massive, as $Z$, 
Higgs and $W^{\pm}$, or massless, as the photon and gluons.

\subsubsection{Fermions}
A fermion is a particle \del{characterized by a non-integer}\add{with a half-integer} spin,
i.e. $1/2$, $3/2$, and follows the Fermi-Dirac statistics \add{which is based
  on the Pauli exclusion principle}. 
\del{The Pauli exclusion principle must be respected.} Fermions are divided in two categories, leptons and quarks, depending 
on the forces through which they interact.  The arrangement of fermions into three generations is dictated by the mass property 
with more massive particles assigned to higher generations, as 
depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:sm}.

Particles of second and third generations are not stable and decay into first-generation 
particles. Leptons do not interact strongly because they are not color charged, so they interact only via 
weak and electromagnetic interaction. They are categorized into 
two groups based on the electric charge: $e$, $\mu$, $\tau$ 
are the charged leptons and $\nu_e$, $\nu_{\mu}$, $\nu_{\tau}$ 
are the neutral ones. These particles form doublets of flavour. 
Neutrinos, due to their neutral nature, interact only weakly so 
their detection is extremely challenging. The six quarks 
participate in all known interactions. The known quarks are, 
in ascending order of mass and generation: up ($u$) and down 
($d$), strange ($s$) and charm ($c$), bottom ($b$), top ($t$), 
and their antiparticles. They primarily interact with each 
other through the strong force by gluons exchange. Free quarks 
have never been observed due to confinement, since they carry 
color charge. Confinement of quarks is a fundamental aspect of 
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) \del{which describes the 
  strong nuclear force}\add{, the theory of strong interactions}.
Quarks combine to form color-neutral 
particles known as hadrons, classified into baryons and mesons. 
Baryons consist of an odd number of quarks, while mesons, 
as mentioned in Subsection \ref{bosons}, are composed of a quark 
and an antiquark. Since quarks have weak electric charge and 
isospin, they can interact with each other and other fermions 
through weak and electromagnetic interactions.

\subsection{History of flavour}
The concept of flavour, namely the presence of three 
duplicates for every family of elementary fermions, was implemented within the SM by introducing 
three copies of the gauge representations of fermion fields, without any fundamental requirement. This view began 
to take shape in the late 1940s. The origin can be traced back to the 
experiment conducted by Conversi, Pancini and Piccioni in 1947. Their experiment 
revealed that negative muons, called at that time $mesotrons$, did not 
undergo nuclear capture as expected. They decayed in electrons, similarly to positive muons, 
therefore they could not be Yukawa particles. In the same year, 
Powell and his group identified a two-step decay process ($\pi \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow e$), 
distinguishing the pion from the muon. Bruno Pontecorvo suggested 
that the muon could be a sort of $isomer$ of the electron, leading to the idea of a second 
generation of elementary fermions. Rochester and Butler discovered 
unusual events in cosmic ray\del{s} pictures, later identified as 
$V-particles$ (later discovered that they originated from neutral kaons). This was 
the first hint of the existence of a second generation of quarks. 
In 1945 the search for decay $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ began. This decay was not found, 
leading to the principle of \add{lepton} conservation\del{ of leptons}. The first negative 
result was reported by Hincks and Pontecorvo in 1948. 
On the hadron side, the second generation of quarks was established in the mid-70s, 
involving the GIM mechanism and the discovery of the charm quark.

Meanwhile, on the leptonic side, the upper limit on the 
branching ratio of $\mu^+ \rightarrow  e^+ \gamma$ \add{decay} was set in 1955.
The discovery of parity violation 
in the late 1950s suggested the weak interaction is 
mediated by bosons. \hlite{Feinberg started thinking}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{the only mentioning of a thinking person}

that $\mu^+ \rightarrow  e^+ \gamma$ could occur 
at a level of $10^{-4}$ if the bosons existed, through a 
loop with neutrino and a boson. This led to the two-neutrino hypothesis, suggesting that 
the neutrino coupled to the muon differs from that coupled to 
the electron, thereby prohibiting $\mu^+ \rightarrow  e^+ \gamma$. The existence of 
two different neutrinos was verified at Brookhaven National Laboratory, by
confirming muon production, and no electron production, from the scattering of neutrinos
coming from pion decays that produced only muons.

After the observation of CP violation in neutral kaon 
decay, a third generation of quarks was hypothesized. After the discoveries of the $\tau$ (1976), 
the $b$ quark (1977), $t$ quark (1995) and $\nu_{\tau}$ (2000), a complete picture was achieved and the concept of flavour was consolidated in the SM.

\subsection{Lepton sector in the Standard Model}\label{leptonsector}
In the SM, only one Higgs field $\Phi$ exists. The 
fermions masses and the mixing term arise from the 
couplings of fermions with Higgs field. In the following, 
I will call the left-handed quark doublets 
as $Q^T_{L}=(u_{L} \ d_{L})$, $u_R$ and $d_R$ the 
right-handed quarks up and down respectively,  
the left-handed lepton doublets as 
$L^T_{L}=(\nu_{L} \ e_{L})$, and $e_R$ 
the right-handed leptons. There 
is no right-handed 
neutrinos. The Yukawa coupling of 
fermions with the Higgs 
field $\mathscr{L}_Y$ is the sum of 
two terms: $\mathscr{L}_e$ 
that describes the leptonic component 
(Eq.\ref{leptoniccomponent}) 
and $\mathscr{L}_q$ that describes the 
quark one (Eq.\ref{quarkcomponent}).
\begin{equation}\label{leptoniccomponent}
    -\mathscr{L}_e=\left(Y_e\right)_{i j} \bar{L}_{L i} e_{R j} \Phi+ \text{ h.c. }
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{quarkcomponent}
        -\mathscr{L}_q=\left(Y_u\right)_{i j} \bar{Q}_{L i} u_{R j} \widetilde{\Phi}+\left(Y_d\right)_{i j} \bar{Q}_{L i} d_{R j} \Phi+\text { h.c. }
\end{equation}

where the term $Y_f \ (f  =  u,d,e)$ describes the 3$\times$3 
Yukawa complex matrices. $\widetilde{\Phi} \equiv i \tau_2 \Phi^*$ 
is the conjugate Higgs field. The mass terms of fermions, 
characterized by the $m_f \bar{f}_L f_R$ form, originate 
from the breaking of the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)$ symmetry 
caused by the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field.
\begin{equation}\label{higgs}
\langle\Phi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{l}
0 \\
v
\end{array}\right) \qquad v \simeq 246 \mathrm{GeV}
\end{equation}
The fermion mass is given by:
\begin{equation}
\left(m_f\right)_{i j}=\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}\left(Y_f\right)_{i j} \qquad f=u, d, e
\end{equation}
Since a right-handed neutrino does not appear in the 
Lagrangian, neutrinos have no mass, as it is formulated 
in the SM. The Yukawa matrices can be diagonalized 
through unitary rotations of the fields, as it follows:
\begin{equation}\label{bbbb}
Y_f=V_f \hat{Y}_f U_f^{\dagger} \qquad f=u, d, e
\end{equation}
where $ \hat{Y}_f $ is the diagonal Yukawa matrix. 
It is possible to label fermions in the rotated basis 
as $f^{\prime}$, so $f_L=V_f f^{\prime}_L$ and $f_R=V_f f^{\prime}_R $. 
Since $V_f$ and $U_f$ are unitary, the rotation will not affect the 
neutral interactions term and the kinetic terms, as we can see 
in $\bar{f}_L \gamma^\mu f_L=\bar{f}_L \gamma^\mu\left(V_f^{\dagger} V_f\right) f_L=\bar{f}_L^{\prime} \gamma^\mu f_L^{\prime}$. 
The coupling between fermion and Higgs boson will be:
\begin{equation}
-\mathscr{L}_{h \bar{f} f}=\frac{(\hat{m}_f)_{i j}}{v} \bar{f}_{L i}^{\prime}f^{\prime}_{R j} h+\text{h.c.} \qquad f=u, d, e
\end{equation}
where $\hat{m}_f$ denotes the diagonalized mass matrix: it is clear that there are no flavour-violating terms.
In the quark sector flavour-violation arises from the rotations 
in Eq.\ref{bbbb} in the charged-current interactions with the $W$ bosons:
\begin{equation}\label{quarkviolation}
\begin{array}{c}
      { \displaystyle 
\mathscr{L}_{C C}  =\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\bar{u}_L \gamma^\mu d_L+\bar{\nu}_L \gamma^\mu e_L\right) W_\mu^{+}+\text {h.c.} }\\
 {\displaystyle=\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\bar{u}^{\prime}_L \gamma^\mu\left(V_u^{\dagger} V_d\right) d_L^{\prime}+\bar{\nu}^{\prime}_L \gamma^\mu\left(V_\nu^{\dagger} V_e\right) e_L^{\prime}\right) W_\mu^{+}+\text {h.c.}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The violation comes from the fact that $V_u \neq V_d$. The mixing 
is controlled by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix 
$V_{CKM}\equiv V^{\dagger}_u V_d $, \cite{PhysRevLett.10.531}. 
Meanwhile, as the lepton sector contains massless neutrinos, 
$V_{\nu}$ can be arbitrarily chosen as $V_{\nu}=V_e$. From the 
preceding discussions, it becomes evident that in the SM with 
massless neutrinos, there is no occurrence of LFV in any form. The 
Lagrangian $\mathscr{L}_Y$ is invariant under three independent 
global $U(1)$ rotations, resulting in the conservation of three 
lepton family numbers: $L_e$, $L_\mu$ and $L_\tau$. However, if the 
Yukawa coupling Lagrangian includes supplementary terms involving the 
lepton fields, flavour violation can occur in the lepton sector. 
Examples of such additions could be a neutrino mass term or a second Higgs doublet.

\subsection{Overview of Charged Lepton Flavour Violation}\label{ovclfv}

There are three different lepton flavours: the electron-lepton $L_e$, 
the muon-lepton $L_{\mu}$ and the tau-lepton $L_{\tau}$. In Table 
\ref{tab:leptons}, the quantum numbers assigned to each lepton are displayed.

\end{table}
\end{center}
In the SM defined with massless 
left-handed neutrinos, Lepton flavour (LF) is a conserved quantity, 
\cite{universe8060299}. Experimental observations have 
demonstrated that, as they travel, neutrinos exhibit flavour 
oscillations, which implies that they must have non-zero masses 
and mixing angles. This phenomenon represents also a violation 
of the conservation of the lepton flavour. The SM, 
while successful in many aspects, fails to explain phenomena 
like neutrino masses and the consequent flavour oscillations. 
Since neutrinos get their masses through renormalizable Yukawa interactions
with the Higgs, the predicted CLFV transitions are suppressed 
by sums over $(\Delta m^2_{i j}/M^2 _W)^2$, as calculated in 
\cite{MARCIANO1977303} and as shown in Section 
\ref{massiveneutrinos}, where $\Delta m^2_{ij}$ is mass-squared 
difference between the neutrino mass eigenstates $i$, $j$ and 
$M_W$ is the $W$ boson mass. The neutrino mass difference is 
very small ($\Delta m^2 _{i j} \leq 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$) with respect to the $W$ boson mass,
and the expected branching ratios  
below $10^{-50}$ are well beyond the experimental reach. Experimental studies 
of the lepton flavour violating process could open a window to new physics. 
Moreover, lepton flavour constitutes an accidental symmetry within the SM, 
not related to the Gauge structure of the theory but coming
from its particle content, especially from the absence of \add{right-handed} \del{RH} neutrinos.

{the only use of RH ?}
%
Minor deviations from the SM can \del{easily} give rise to extra 
occurrences of lepton flavour violation, leading to notable rates of CLFV.
There are various extensions of the SM that could potentially 
be examined in the upcoming experimental searches for CLFV, that 
I will report in the next sections.


\subsection{CLFV in the SM with massive neutrinos}\label{massiveneutrinos}
The first evidence against the hypotesis of massless neutrinos emerged with the solar neutrino problem. In the 1960s, the solar neutrino detection experiment at Homestake revealed that the observed number of solar neutrinos, generated by fusion in the Sun, was significantly lower than the anticipated value based on the standard solar model, given that the detector was only sensitive to $\nu_e$, \cite{PhysRevLett.20.1205}. Consistent results were replicated in subsequent experiments using radiochemical and Cherenkov detectors, discovering neutrino oscillations. These oscillations firmly established non-zero neutrino masses. The lepton flavour-violating neutrino oscillations showed that the global $U(1)$ symmetries associated with the lepton family numbers are not fundamental symmetries. A correction to SM is needed to include neutrino mass terms. This is possible adding a right-handed neutrino singlet $\nu_R$ or some non-renormalizable operators.
\\
In the first case, an additional term $\Delta \mathscr{L}_D$ to the Yukawa coupling should be introduced:
\begin{equation}
-\Delta \mathscr{L}_D=\left(Y_\nu\right)_{i j} \bar{\nu}_{R i}  \widetilde{\Phi}^\dagger L_{Lj}+\text { h.c. }
\end{equation}

Similarly to other fermions, a Dirac mass term $m_{\nu} \bar{\nu}_L \nu_R$ is generated through simmetry breaking:
\begin{equation}
\left(m_\nu^D\right)_{i j}=\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}\left(Y_\nu\right)_{i j}
\end{equation}
In this case, the small neutrino masses can be explained only if a very small term $Y_\nu$ is considered ($\leq 10^{-12}$), \cite{clfv_signorelli}. This brings us considering the second hypotesis: adding non-renormalizable operators can introduce Majorana masses for left-handed neutrinos alone. The corresponding $\Delta \mathscr{L}_M$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
-\Delta \mathscr{L}_M=\frac{1}{2}\left(m_\nu^M\right)_{i j} \overline{\nu_{L i}^C} \nu_{L j}+\text{ h.c.}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\nu_{L }^C} $ is the charge-conjugated fields. This term violates lepton number and requires an operator of dimension 5, \cite{wein}, to be consistent with SM symmetries. A minimal Lagrangian is given by:
\begin{equation}
-\Delta \mathscr{L}_{M \text { eff}}=\frac{\mathcal{C}_{i j}}{\Lambda}\left(\overline{L_{L i}^C} \tau_2 \Phi\right)\left(\Phi^T \tau_2 L_{L j}\right)+\text { h.c.}
\end{equation}
where the $\Lambda$ term represents a mass scale characteristic of extra degrees of freedom and the $C_{ij}$ is an antisymmetric charge conjugation matrix. The corresponding Majorana mass term is:
\begin{equation}
\left(m_\nu^M\right)_{i j}=\frac{\mathcal{C}_{i j} v^2}{\Lambda}
\end{equation}
In this case, the small neutrino masses can be explained only if $\Lambda > > v$: this seems to appear more natural than the previous case. No matter how the extra neutrino mass factor is expressed precisely, a physical basis diagonalizing the mass matrix is determined, resulting in $V_{\nu} \neq V_e$ in Equation \ref{quarkviolation}. Lepton mixing is described by $U_{PMNS} \equiv V_{\nu}^{\dagger} V_e$, which is similar to the CKM matrix. The Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix is the term that is typically used to refer to it. As it is in the basis diagonalizing charged lepton masses and it diagonalizes the neutrino mass matrix, $U_{PMNS}$ also explains the mixing between neutrino flavour eigenstates $\nu_{\alpha}$ and mass eigenstates $\nu_i$:
\begin{equation}
\nu_\alpha=\sum_{i=1,2,3}\left(U_{\mathrm{PMNS}}\right)_{l i} \ \nu_i \qquad l=e, \mu, \tau
\end{equation}
In addition to the neutral Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV) observed in neutrino oscillations, the mixing outlined by $U_{PMNS}$ can in principle give rise to CLFV processes, i.e. LFV that involves charged leptons. The new Feynman diagrams are loops involving neutrinos and $W$ bosons, as $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ in Fig.\ref{fig:mutoegamma} and $\mu N \rightarrow e N$ in Fig.\ref{fig:mutoeN}.

        \label{fig:three graphs2}
\end{figure}
In the SM, each of these mechanisms is significantly suppressed. Using the example of $\mu \rightarrow  e \gamma $, the branching ratio of this process may be computed as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{br}
\begin{aligned}
B R(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma) & =\frac{3 \alpha}{32 \pi}\left|\sum_{i=2,3} U_{\mu i}^* U_{e i} \frac{\Delta m_{1 i}^2}{M_W^2}\right|^2 \\
& =\frac{3 \alpha}{32 \pi}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \sin ^2 2 \theta_{13} \sin ^2 \theta_{23}\left|\frac{\Delta m_{13}^2}{M_W^2}\right|^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $U_{\mu i}$ and $U_{ei}$ are 
corresponding elements in the PMNS matrix, $\Delta m_{1i}^2$ are the neutrino 
squared mass differences, $M_W$ is the $W$ boson mass and $\theta_{13}$ and 
$\theta_{23}$ are rotating angles in PMNS matrix parametrization, \cite{MARCIANO1977303}.

As mentioned in \ref{ovclfv}, the expression yields $B R(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-54})$. 
The big discrepancy in mass between neutrinos and the $W$ boson results in an 
extraordinarily small value for $|\Delta m_{13}^2/M_W|$.


The rates predicted by the SM are extremely small, 
making them impractical for detection in any experiment. On the 
other hand, numerous Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories 
incorporate mechanisms that substantially amplify CLFV rates, a 
topic to be addressed in the subsequent section. Any experimental observation of 
any CLFV process would unequivocally indicate physics beyond the SM.

\subsection{Beyond the Standard Model}
Numerous BSM theories propose mechanisms that could contribute to 
CLFV processes, potentially yielding experimentally detectable rates. 
Here, we highlight a selection of BSM theories known for their CLFV 
contributions. It is important to note that this list is not 
comprehensive; for further studies, additional reviews are available 
in \cite{clfv_signorelli} and \cite{universe8060299}.
\subsubsection{CLFV in Supersymmetry}\label{susy}
Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical framework that has oriented 
experiments in the CLFV reasearch for many years. On one hand, 
models with SUSY broken at energies close to electro-weak scale 
have given solution to the hierarchy problem, i.e. how to maintain 
the Higgs mass significantly smaller than the Planck scale ($\sim$10$^{19}$ GeV). 
In this framework, each elementary particle has a superpartner, 
with the same quantum numbers except for spin: a boson is the superpartner 
of a fermion and vice versa. A superpartner of a lepton is called $slepton$. 
If there is no common eigenstate base between lepton and $slepton$'s mass 
matrices then a physical $slepton$ will be a superposition of flavours.
On the other hand, the suppression of CLFV processes is due to the wide 
separation of the neutrinos and $W$ masses, which can be mitigated by 
introducing SUSY partners of neutrinos and $W$ bosons. This suggests 
that CLFV processes should have been observable earlier, unless SUSY 
breaking occurs at or near the electroweak scale ($\sim 10^2$ GeV), \cite{clfv_signorelli}.

In this case a loop diagram can lead to CLFV, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:susy}. 
Despite the similar topology to that of the SM contribution (Fig.\ref{fig:mutoegamma}), 
the typical SUSY mass is expected to be much higher than that of the neutrinos. 
Predictions for the branching ratio of this process vary among different SUSY models, 
contingent upon specific mechanisms and particle masses. These rates can \del{undergo 
  significant enhancement}\add{be significantly enhanced}.
For example, in an $SU(5)$ SUSY grand unified theory, the 
computed branching ratio could reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})$ for a 
slepton mass on the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{2}$ GeV/c$^2)$, 
a value measurable \del{for}\add{by} upcoming experiments, \cite{clfv_signorelli}.

\label{fig:susy}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Two Higgs Doublet model}\label{2higgs}
Although the SM incorporates only one Higgs boson, there are 
no constraints against the presence of additional Higgs fields. 
One straightforward example of a comprehensive theory featuring 
multiple Higgs fields is the two Higgs doublet model 
(2HDM), where two Higgs bosons exist, each interacting with 
fermions and possessing a vacuum expectation value, \cite{Harnik_2013}.

Generally, the Lagrangian incorporating extra Higgs fields post-electroweak symmetry breaking can be written as:
\begin{equation}
-\mathscr{L}=m_i \bar{f}_{L i} f_{R i}+\left(Y^\alpha\right)_{i j} \bar{f}_{L i} f_R{ }_j h^\alpha+\text { h.c. }+\ldots
\end{equation}
Non-renormalizable terms of higher dimensions are omitted. $(Y^\alpha)_{i j}$ represents couplings to a single scalar field and the contributions from different Higgses are summed over. The non-zero-off-diagonal terms in $(Y^\alpha)_{i j}$ give rise to flavour violating Yukawa couplings. From accelerator and precision experiments, constraints on the off-diagonal coupling of the 125 GeV Higgs boson can be obtained.
\subsubsection{Leptoquark models}
Leptoquarks (LQs) are hypothetical particles initially 
proposed within the Pati-Salam model, \cite{PhysRevD.10.275}. 
A LQ posesses both a baryon number ($B$) and a lepton number ($L$). 
In various LQ models the quark and lepton sectors are unified. This 
unification allows for direct coupling between quarks and leptons via 
the exchange of LQs. Consequently, specific CLFV processes like 
$K_L^0 \rightarrow e \mu$ and $\mu N \rightarrow e N$ are mediated by LQs. 
Constraints on LQ models arise from both collider experiments and rare decay 
searches. Direct searches at ATLAS and CMS have already excluded scalar LQs of the 
first and second generations with masses below $\sim$1 TeV.

Additionally, LQ models must satisfy constraints related to 
proton stability, as some models involve LQs that could mediate 
proton decay. To mitigate this, the corresponding LQs must either 
have extremely high masses or their related couplings must be 
exceedingly small, \cite{DORSNER20161}.
\subsubsection{Additional Neutral Gauge Boson}
Grand unified theories (GUTs) are constructed based on 
extended Gauge groups in the pursuit of a more fundamental model. 
At lower energies, these extended gauge groups break down to the 
direct product of the SM Gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ 
along with an additional $U(1)$ factor. The neutral Gauge boson 
associated with this $U(1)$ group can mix with the original SM 
neutral Gauge boson, resulting in two mass eigenstates, namely 
$Z$ and $Z'$. Additionally, extended Gauge theories require the 
introduction of additional fermion fields to cancel anomaly-free 
currents beyond those of $SU(5)$. These $new$ fermions can mix 
with the known SM fermions possessing the same electric and color 
charges, consequently affecting their couplings with Gauge bosons. 
The appearance of off-diagonal terms in neutral current couplings 
to fermions can lead to flavour-changing couplings to $Z$ and $Z'$. 
Certain CLFV processes, such as $\mu \rightarrow eee$ and $\mu-e$ 
conversion, receive tree-level contributions through intermediate 
$Z$ and $Z'$ bosons. Further insights into the phenomenology of the 
$Z'$ boson can be found in, \cite{Leike_1999}. The search for 
$Z'$ bosons is conducted using channels like $Z' \rightarrow \bar{f}f$ 
at hadron colliders. Lower limits on the $Z'$ mass from various models 
are listed in \cite{zyla}, primarily falling within the low TeV range. 
Particularly, the limits reported in CLFV final states $e\mu$, $e\tau$ 
and $\mu\tau$ range in between 3.5 TeV and 4.5 TeV. Upper limits on the 
$Z \rightarrow l_1 l_2$ couplings of the SM $Z$ boson are also provided 
in Table \ref{tab:upperlimits}.

\section{Experiments searching for CLFV}
CLFV has not been observed yet, despite the ongoing efforts to 
detect such violation in different channels in both dedicated and general-purpose experiments.

Some of these efforts are documented in Table \ref{tab:upperlimits}, which 
presents their respective experimental upper limits. 
In addition to searches at collider experiments, such as observing $Z$ and 
Higgs decays, rare decay experiments play a significant role as a complementary method in the search for CLFV. 
Collider experiments enable the exploration of various CLFV channels simultaneously, 
including those involving $\tau$ leptons. 
However, complexities in data selection and reconstruction 
present challenges to improve the limits in this field.
Rare decay experiments, by focusing on specific processes or a 
set of similar processes, can achieve high statistics using an intense particle beam. 
By suppressing background\add{s}\del{ signals}, these experiments can 
significantly improve \add{the} sensitivity. Furthermore, this approach 
enables the investigation of high mass scales, as will be explained in next sections.

\vspace{-15mm}
\subsection{$\mu$ Channels}
The most promising channel is currently represented by muons. 
There are three primary CLFV channels involving muons: 
$\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma$, $\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N$ and $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ e^+ e^-$. 
As seen in Table \ref{tab:upperlimits}, 
these channels have the lowest branching ratio limits: 
\del{their}\add{muon} production is highly favored in pion and kaon decays, 
which are easily produced through hadronic interactions, and  
\del{moreover their} sufficiently long \add{muon} lifetime enables the 
formation of \del{a stable} muon beam\add{s}. \hlite{Current technology 
  supports muon beam intensities in the range of $10^8$ to $10^{11} \ \mu/\text{s}$.}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{not clear what this means, explain}

However, muons have small mass with respect to $\tau$s, that results
in a limited number of decay modes \add{available for studies}. 

Muon rare decay studies can also provide theory differentiation power 
combining results of the three channels. We can consider the following model-independent 
Effective Field Theory (EFT) Lagrangian of the $e \mu$ CLFV mode, \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev-nucl-100809-131949}:
\begin{equation}\label{LCF}
\begin{aligned}
\mathscr{L}_{C L F V}= & \frac{m_\mu}{(1+\kappa) \Lambda^2} \bar{\mu}_R \sigma_{\mu \nu} e_L F^{\mu \nu}+\text{h.c.}+ \\
&\frac{\kappa}{(1+\kappa) \Lambda^2} \bar{\mu}_L \gamma_\mu e_L\left(\sum_{q=u, d} \bar{q}_L \gamma^\mu \bar{q}_L\right)+\text{h.c.}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$m_\mu$ is the muon mass and  $F^{\mu \nu}$ is the electromagnetic field tensor.

$\Lambda$ represents the effective mass scale of the new degree of freedom, and $\kappa$
determines the relative strengths of the two operators. The first term in the Lagrangian,
called \add{the} dipole term, represents a
magnetic moment type operator which directly mediates $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$. 
The second one corresponds to a four-fermion interaction term, 
which mediates $\mu N \rightarrow eN$ at \add{a} tree level and 
the other two processes at one-loop level.
The Mu2e experiment can probe \del{an}\add{the} effective mass scale up 
to $\mathcal{O}$(10$^4$ TeV) with its designed sensitivity assuming $\kappa$ $\gg$ 1.
On the other hand, $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ \add{search} experiments 
are more sensitive when $\kappa$ $\ll$ 1; the dominant magnetic
moment type term determines the other two processes have 
lower rates in such a case. In order to learn more about the new
physics, one needs to combine information involving rates 
of different CLFV processes, \cite{osti_1042577}.
The corresponding parameter space (the $\Lambda$-$\kappa$ plane) is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:muchannelbr}, \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev-nucl-100809-131949}. 

Figure \ref{fig:muchannel} 
shows how the branching ratio limits of muon rare decays
have \del{rapidly} improved over the last several decades. The following paragraphs 
will discuss the experimental challenges and future perspectives 
for each of these channels. The next generation 
experiments aim to improve the search sensitivity by many orders of magnitude.

\subsubsection{$\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma$}
A clear signal of CLFV, in $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma$ channel, is given by back-to-back electron and photon, each one with energy of 52.8 MeV, 
both produced simultaneously. Positive muons are preferred since the negative ones may undergo the nuclear capture. 
Muons are stopped and decay at rest. There are two most significant sources of background: 
Radiative Muon Decay (RMD) $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu \gamma$ 
and the accidental coincidence of $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu$ with a random $\gamma$ 
generated by annihilation or bremsstrahlung. The first one is an in-time process, 
where neutrinos carry off a small part of the energy 
and it is only a small part of the total background. The accidental background 
is dominant. \hlite{Since both backgrounds scale with the muon stop rate $\Gamma_\mu$},
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{why would accidental background scale as $\Gamma_\mu$ ?}

a continuous beam is preferred.
Moreover, since a higher number of stopped muons correspond to a lower statistical error, but at the same time, to a lower signal to background ratio, an optimal $\Gamma_\mu$ exists.
The stopping target thickness must be optimized: a thin target is needed to minimise
the \hlite{Multiple Coulomb Scattering}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{lowercase}
\del{,} which affects the angular resolution of the outgoing electron, but 
it must be thick enough to stop a significant portion of incoming muons. 
\paragraph{The MEG Experiment}
The MEG experiment, \cite{megi}, has been designed around two concepts: exploiting a liquid
xenon detector (LXe) for positron and photon tracking and an anti-bottle magnetic field, \cite{clfv_signorelli}. 
The apparatus is shown in Figure \ref{fig:meg}. A polyethylene target is used to stop muons in the center of the magnet. 
The measured quantities are the electron and photon energies ($E_e$ and $E_\gamma$) and the
relative positions (angles $\theta_{e\gamma}$, $\phi_{e\gamma}$ and time $t_{e \gamma}$).
A combination of a drift chamber (DCH) and plastic scintillator timing counters (TC) measure the positron momentum.

The photon energy and direction are measured in a volume of LXe with more than 800 photo-multipliers tubes. 
An energy resolution of less than 1\% for each particle is required to distinguish background from the signal. 
In MEG, the magnetic field decreases uniformly from centre to periphery, pushing particles away from the centre. 
The exact shape of the field has been chosen to have a track radius proportional to the absolute momentum.
This allows low energy positrons to be discarded by simply placing the detector far enough away from the magnet axis. 
This feature is unique to the MEG magnetic system and justifies its name as \textit{COnstant Bending RAdius} (COBRA) magnets.
The DCH spectrometer is composed by 16 trapezoidal drift chambers oriented radially and filled with He-C$_2$H$_6$. 
The timing from the DCH and TC is used to assess the radial coordinate, whereas the $z$ location is determined by measuring the induced
charged on the zig-zag shaped pads on the side of the drift chambers. The core momentum resolution for $e^+$ is $\sim$ 330 keV.
A liquid xenon scintillating detector was used for photon reconstruction to reduce passive material and improve temporal resolution. 
This option provides \del{more}\add{higher} light yield than NaI crystals 
and has a substantially shorter decay period, with a timing resolution below 100 ps.

MEG collected $7.5 \times 10^{14}$ stopped muons in 2008-2013, 
setting a limit of $BR(\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma) < 4.2 \times 10^{-13}$ at 90\% CL, \cite{megi}.

\caption[MEG detector.]{Schematic view of the MEG detector, \cite{megi}.}

\end{figure}
\paragraph{The MEG II experiment}
The MEG II detector is the upgrade of the MEG detector, \cite{megiicollaboration2024operation}.
\hlite{MEG II was proposed to reduce the contamination}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{MEG II was not proposed to reduce the contamination, rephrase}
due to the accidental background that could not be further reduced in MEG.
Figure \ref{fig:meg22} shows the apparatus. The muon flux was increased up to $7 \times 10^7 \ \mu^+$/s and a thinner but more inclined 
stopping target was installed to reduce the multiple scattering and bremsstrahlung 
while keeping the same stopping power (205 $\rightarrow$ 140 $\mu$m).
The old drift chamber was replaced with a new cylindrical drift chamber (CDCH) designed
to have higher granularity and transparency and made of 9 layers of drift cells to
improve positron track reconstruction. CDCH is shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:meg2}.
A more segmented system (pixellated-TC) was adopted instead of plastic scintillator timing counters (TC).
A Radiative Decay Counter was introduced, that is a target of scintillator and LYSO calorimeter positioned transversely to detect positron from RMD emitted at low angle.
When combined with the final result of MEG, MEG II collaboration obtained the most stringent limit up to date, $BR(\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma)<3.1\times 10^{-13}$ 90\% CL, \cite{megiicollaboration2024search}.
The MEG II collaboration took data in 2022 and 2023, collecting much more statistics compared to 2021. By 2026, more than twenty-fold increase in statistics is foreseen, with the goal of reaching a
$BR(\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ \gamma)\lesssim 6\times 10^{-14}$ 90\% CL.

\end{figure}






\subsubsection{$\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ e^-  e^+ $}
The signature of \del{the}\add{a} $\mu^+$ decay at rest consists of two $e^+$ and one $e^-$ at the same time, 
with total energy equal to the muon mass and null vector sum of the
particle momenta.
Since this is a three-body decay, where the momenta of the particles 
range from a few MeV (depending on the $\mu^+$ speed) to about half the mass of the muon, it is crucial 
to use a tracker that is both thin and low-mass, with an excellent resolution. 
It is also important to estimate the probability
of having the three particles with momenta above the \del{detector}\add{detection} threshold.

There are two main sources of background. The first one is the radiative muon decay with 
internal conversion $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ e^+ e^- \nu_e \bar{\nu}_\mu$. 
This process has a branching ratio of $BR\sim 3.4 \times 10^{-5}$, and it is 
indistinguishable from the signal when the neutrinos have very low energy. 

The second source of background is due to the coincidence 
of one Michel decay with a $e^+e^-$ pair (1-MD) or two Michel decays with a single $e^-$ (2-MD). 
In this case, the $e^+e^-$ pair can be produced by Bhabha scattering or photon conversion, while the $e^+$
can be produced by Compton scattering or mis-reconstructed $e^+$ and $e^+e^-$ (with the $e^-$ not reconstructed). 
As a consequence, this source of background depends on the muon rate and
can be suppressed with precise vertex reconstruction, timing and track reconstruction.
As in the previous channel, the use of a continuous beam is preferred.


\paragraph{SINDRUM I}
The current best limit, $BR(\mu^+ \rightarrow e^- e^+ e^+) < 1.0 \times 10^{- 12}$ at 90\% CL, was set by the
SINDRUM I experiment at PSI, \cite{sindrumi}. A schematic view of the SINDRUM spectrometer is given in Figure \ref{fig:sindrumi}. 
The spectrometer consisted of a double cone-shaped stopping target in the middle of five concentric multi-wire proportional chambers surrounded by an array of plastic
scintillator counters inside a solenoidal magnetic field. Considering a 50 MeV $e^-/e^+$, the detector 
apparatus had a momentum resolution at the level of $\sim$1 MeV,
a timing resolution $\leq$1 ns and a vertex resolution of $\sim$1 cm. 
The trigger consisted of a charge filter, requiring one negative and two 
positive particles, within a time window of 7 ns, \cite{universe8060299}.

\caption[SINDRUM experiment.]{Schematic view of the SINDRUM experiment, \cite{sindrumi}.}
\label{fig:sindrumi}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Mu3e Experiment}
The goal of the Mu3e experiment is to achieve a single-event-sensitivity of the order
of $10^{-16}$ on the $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ e^-  e^+ $ decay, \cite{hesketh2022mu3e} and \cite{papa}. 
A schematic view of Mu3e is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mu3e}.
The same muon beam \del{as}\add{with} MEG II experiment will be used, stopping muons on a thin hollow double-cone Mylar target. 
\hlite{A 2 m cylinder will be placed inside a 1.5 T magnetic field and segmented in 5 sections}.
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{what is the cylinder?}

The central station will consist of two double layers of pixel detectors and a
scintillating fiber tracker. The other four stations will be made of two layers of pixel
sensors and a hodoscope of scintillator. Since the Mu3e search relies heavily on accurate track reconstruction, multiple Coulomb
scattering is a limiting factor and the technical choices adopted for the detector design
have been taken to minimize this effect. The tracker consists of High Voltage Monolithic Active Pixels (HV-MAPS) 
and the design is such as to exploit the (partial) canceling of
the multiple scattering in half of turn. The estimated time and vertex resolutions are
$\sigma_t \sim 100$ ps and $\sigma_{xy} \sim 200 \ \mu$m and the momentum resolution will be 100 $\div$ 400 keV for 10 $\div$ 53
MeV particles. The experiment is projected in three phases. During the first one, the beam will have an intensity of $\mathcal{O}(10^7) \ \mu^+$/s 
and there will be only the tracker installed. After that, the beam with an intensity of $\mathcal{O}(10^8) \ \mu^+$/s will 
be used and the scintillating fibers and two of the additional tracking stations will be added.
During the third phase, the beam intensity will increase up to $\mathcal{O}(10^9) \ \mu^+$/s and to 
reach the single-event-sensitivity of $10^{-16}$, two more tracking stations will be added.

\end{figure}









\subsubsection{$\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N $}
In the process of neutrino-less coherent muon to electron conversion, 
$\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N$, the energy of the muon is completely 
transferred to the electron, as the energy transferred to the nuclear 
recoil is almost negligible. Consequently, the signal manifests 
\add{itself} as a monochromatic electron with 105 MeV energy. A significant 
advantage of this conversion search, compared to the 
$\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ search, is the higher momentum 
and better separation of the electron signal from the background. 
Thanks to the one particle final state, this channel is not affected
by \add{an} accidental
background and can benefit from a beam intensity increase.
Moreover, $\mu^- N \rightarrow e^- N $ has the best sensitivity to CLFV in a large range of 
new physics scenarios (Eq. \ref{LCF}), as it is sensitive to both the four-fermion interaction and dipole terms.

To cancel out uncertainties due to the overlap of the 
nucleus and the muon wave functions, the quantity often 
used to represent the results of such searches is defined as: 
\begin{equation} 
  R_{\mu e} = \frac{N(\mu \rightarrow e)}{N(\text{muon capture})} 
\end{equation} 

The muon capture process occurs extremely fast, 
on the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$ s, and is 
accompanied by the emission of an X-ray, which can be detected. 
By measuring the X-rays emitted during muon capture, the denominator of 
the above ratio can be accurately determined. As no coincidence 
is required, the experiment's success depends \del{largely} on \del{effective}\add{efficient} electron reconstruction.

The primary sources of background from muon decay include: 
\begin{itemize} 
  \item \hlite{Electrons from muon decay-in-orbit (DIO), which exhibit a 
      long energy tail}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{electrons don't have a tail}


    and can contaminate the signal region. 
    \hlite{The DIO is an intrinsic background}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{intrinsic with respect to what ?}

    , but the probability of 
  contamination within the last MeV is less than $10^{-16}$, 
  and it can be controlled with precise momentum resolution; 
  \item High-energy photons generated by radiative captures of pions (RPC) 
  and muons (RMC), which can asymmetrically convert and produce high-energy 
  electrons. \hlite{RPC and RMC can be mitigated using a pulsed beam combined with a delayed 
  time window gate};
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{science fiction: RMC has the same time dependence as the mu-->e conversion process}

  \item Cosmic rays, which can either generate electrons or be misidentified as 
  electrons within the signal region. The cosmic ray background can be reduced 
  by employing a veto system around the detector. 
\end{itemize}

\hlite{In a $doughnut$-shaped experimental setup, the background 
  from low-momentum particles can be reduced to manageable levels}.

\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{what is doughnut-shaped? }

A more detailed discussion of signals and background sources is provided in Section \ref{sigandbkg}.

The use of a curved transport solenoid helps \add{to} suppress 
prompt background by a factor of $10^{10}$, eliminates 
neutral particles, and selects particles based on momentum. 
To prevent spurious pion production, it is essential to maintain the 
extinction factor - defined as the fraction of protons that strike the 
production target \hlite{outside the desired time window} - below $10^{-10}$.

{explain is the desired time window}

\hlite{Among all available channels, this method offers the highest sensitivity.}
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{method or channel?}


Additionally, this experimental setup is \hlite{conducive} to
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{a very rare word in English}

searching for the process $\mu^- N \rightarrow e^+ N$, which would also violate lepton number conservation.
\paragraph{SINDRUM II}
PSI delivered a 1 MW 590 MeV proton 
beam that was extracted from the ring
cyclotron and directed onto a 40 
mm carbon target. The beam line
transported secondary particles ($\pi$, $\mu$, $e$) 
emitted in the backward 
direction to the SINDRUM II spectrometer 
(Figure \ref{fig:sindrumii}).
The overall structure of the experiment
was cylindrical and the target (B), 
which had a radius of 20 mm, was positioned
in the middle of the detector.

Two drift chambers (F and G) were adopted to measure
the helical trajectories, with the 
ionization electrons drifting radially 
towards the amplification 
regions. The tracker used CO$_2$-isobutane 
(70\%/30\%) as a drift
gas while the second one He-isobutane 
(85\%/15\%). Two 3 mm thick plastic 
scintillator hodoscopes (D) and a 3 cm 
thick plexiglass Cherenkov hodoscope 
(E) provided trigger and time information. 
The device included two end-cap hodoscopes 
at opposite ends of the tracking zone to 
aid in triggering 
and resolving ambiguities during event reconstruction.

The number of muons stopped
was monitored observing the characteristic 
muonic gold X-rays passing through the
superconducting coil of the spectrometer. 
A Ge(Li) detector was used for this purpose.
SINDRUM II set the limit on the 
muon conversion on Au target 
(currently the best limit) at $7 \times 10^{-13}$, 
\cite{SINDRUMII:2006dvw}.

Mu2e will make use of an 8 GeV,

$S$ shape lowers the background due to 
neutral particles and selects the 
\del{charge}\add{muon beam} sign\del{: almost only negative 
muons will hit the stopping target}. 
The straw tube tracker and the crystal 
electromagnetic calorimeter are located 
downstream of the Al target. 
Both these detectors adopted a 
\textit{hollow-cylinder} geometry. 
The estimated Mu2e sensitivity after 
three years of data taking is

\cite{universe9010054}.
Mu2e will be described 
extensively in the Chapter \ref{mu2echapter}.

The Mu2e Collaboration is also 
performing preliminary studies for 
the upgraded \add{detector,} Mu2e II, \cite{dukes}. 
The proton beam intensity will be 
improved by the PIP-II upgrade that 
will increase the rate of stopped muons 
on target from $10^{10} \ \mu^-$/s 
to $10^{11} \ \mu^-$/s. New detector 
technologies are under study for the upgraded
Mu2e II.
\paragraph{DeeMe}
A simpler setup will be adopted 
by the Direct emission of electron 
from Muon to electron conversion (DeeMe) 
experiment at J-PARC to search 
the muon-to-electron conversion, \cite{deeme}.
A pictorial view of DeeMe experiment is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:deeme}.
The experiment will use the Muon 
Science Establishment's new beam-line (H-line), 
which will provide 3 GeV protons 
(a pair of bunches separated by 600 ns at 25 Hz) 
that will hit on the production target. 
Some muons ($\mathcal{O}(10^{10})\mu$/s) 
will be stopped in the target itself, 
allowing for a search for $\mu \rightarrow e$ 
with just one target. The signal will be detected 
with multi-wire proportional chambers and a 
spectrometer. 
A dipole will remove low momentum background 
particles from the transport system. 
The experiment aims to achieve a single-event 
sensitivity of $10^{-13}$ using a graphite target, 
and later of $10^{-14} \div 10^{-15}$ 
(depending on running duration) using a 
silicon carbide (SiC) target with a higher 
capture rate.

\paragraph{COMET}
The COherent Muon-to-Electron 
Transition (COMET) experiment is 
under construction at
the Japanese Proton Accelerator 
Research Center (J-PARC), \cite{Abramishvili_2020}. 
This experiment shares several 
characteristics with Mu2e. COMET 
will use a 8 GeV, 56 kW pulsed proton beam
with 1.17 $\mu$s spaced bunches. 
The two primary differences between 
the COMET and Mu2e experiments can 
be observed in the schematic representations 
provided in Figure \ref{fig:comet}. First, 
COMET employs a C-shaped transport solenoid, 
in contrast to the S-shaped one used in Mu2e. 
\hlite{This design leads to a trade-off: while the 
beam intensity is reduced by approximately 
70\% compared to Mu2e, the momentum selection 
of muons is more refined. Specifically, in 
COMET, the muons that stop in the target 
have momenta between 30 and 50 MeV/c, whereas 
in Mu2e, there is no lower momentum cut-off. }
\todo[inline,color=green!20,linecolor=gray,tickmarkheight=10pt]
{why is that a trade-off ? not clear what is gained by the selection of p>30 MeV/c}


Secondly, COMET introduces an 
additional curved solenoid after 
the stopping target. This solenoid serves 
to remove electrons, including those 
up to and beyond the Michel peak, 
before they reach the tracker.

COMET will have two stages: Phase-I and Phase-II.
\subparagraph*{Phase-I} The first phase 
involves understanding the experimental 
techniques and studying the backgrounds, 
making an intermediate
measurement of the $\mu-e$ conversion at a 90\% CL 
sensitivity on $R_{\mu e} \sim 7\times 10^{-15}$.

The proton power will be restricted to 
3.2 kW and a single 90$^o$ bend will be utilized.
The major challenge is the short distance 
between all the elements. 
To track electrons, a cylindrical drift 
chamber will be used. To trigger and time the tracker, 
scintillating hodoscopes will surround the tracker. 
\subparagraph*{Phase-II} A straw tube 
tracker and a LYSO crystal electromagnetic 
calorimeter will be adopted to deal 
with the increased particle rate. 
The entire magnetic system will be expanded.

\subsection{$\tau$ Channels}
The $\tau$ lepton is a very promising 
source of CLFV decays, \cite{universe8060299}. 
The large $\tau$ mass ($m_\tau$ $\sim$ 1.777 GeV) 
allows \del{for the investigation of}\add{to study} multiple CLFV
channels, with respect to muon decays, 
\cite{clfv_signorelli}. 
Some of these processes are 
$\tau \rightarrow l \gamma$ (radiative decay), $\tau \rightarrow 3l$ (three-body decay) 
and $\tau\rightarrow l \ h$, 
where $h$ is a light hadron and $l$ 
is an electron or muon. The $\tau$ 
sector of a CLFV search takes advantage 
from a higher predicted branching ratio, 
compared to muons, 
according to $(\frac{m_\tau}{m_\mu})^\alpha$, 
where $\alpha$ depends on the model. 

However, the search is affected by \del{its}\add{the}  
short $\tau$ lifetime  
($\tau_\tau \ \sim$ 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ s), that 
makes not possible to produce 
$\tau$ beams.

To constrain the kinematics of decay, 
large detectors with good particle 
identification, tracking, calorimetry, 
and hermeticity are required. 
Because $\tau$ CLFV searches are performed  
with beams and detectors used for a 
broader physics programme, 
the increased sensitivity derived by 
its greater mass is partially decreased 
by the number of $\tau$s that can be detected.

In these experiments, a pair of 
$\tau^+ \tau^-$ is produced by the 
decay of $\Upsilon(4s)$ resonance at 
$\sqrt{s}=10.58$ GeV. The branching ratio 
of this process is  $90\%$ of 
the one of $b \bar{b}$. One $\tau$\add{-lepton} decays 
via SM process (tag side), 
while the signal side is determined based on 
the specific topology of each channel. 
At $e^+ e^-$ and $pp$ colliders, the $\tau$s 
are not created at rest. Because of the boost, 
the decay products could have 
energy of several GeV, posing an experimental 
challenge of providing wide-range calibrations 
for detectors (from a few hundred MeV to several GeV), 
\cite{universe8060299}.

Table \ref{tab:upperlimits} lists the 
current best limits on the $\tau$ 
CLFV searches and Figure \ref{fig:tauchannel} 
displays the results from the BaBar, 
\cite{PhysRevD.77.091104}, Belle, 
\cite{ABASHIAN2002117} and LHCb, 
\cite{TheLHCbCollaboration2008}.

  are respectively the Belle and Babar's best upper limits. The red dots are Belle II's expected upper limits for the 50 ab$^{-1}$ run.}
  \label{fig:tauchannel}
  \end{figure}
In a short time, the Belle 2 experiment at 
Super KEKB will try to increase its limits 
below $5 \times 10^{-9}$ or $10^{-9}$ for 
the radiative and three body decays respectively, 
with an integrated luminosity of 50 ab$^{-1}$. 
The main background, in radiative decay  
channel only, arises from
$e^+ e^- \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^- \gamma$ or 
$e^+ e^- \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^- \gamma$ 
where one of the $\tau$s decays via 
$\tau \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu}$.
To reduce the background, it is possible to 
use the $\tau$ polarization or to collect 
large samples of
$\tau$ leptons at a lower center-of-mass energy, 
where initial state radiation is negligible in 
the signal region. This might be the \del{situation}\add{case}
\del{in}\add{for} a $\tau$-charm 
factory operating slightly above the $\tau$ 
production threshold, \cite{Bennett_2016}.
