\chapter{First steps towards the station calibration}\label{planning}
\textit{Following the comprehensive testing of the DAQ and FEE, the subsequent crucial 
step towards achieving a fully operational tracker is the calibration phase. This 
calibration will be carried out exploiting cosmic muons. The primary objective of 
this calibration process is to accurately determine signal propagation times and 
channel-to-channel delays within each straw. To accomplish this, it is essential 
to perform an unbiased reconstruction of the longitudinal position of the hits 
within the straws. This would be easily achieved using the station orientated horizontally. 
However, certain technical and mechanical contingencies prevent horizontal calibration, 
necessitating the exclusive focus on vertical orientation.
In this Chapter, I am focusing on 
reconstructing the trajectories of cosmic muons within a vertically oriented 
station, as well as analyzing potential biases and systematic errors that could 
arise from this particular orientation.}
\section{Overview of the timing calibration}
The main goal of this calibration is to 
determine signal propagation 
and channel-to-channel delays for each straw.
When a charged particle crosses the straw tube 
gas volume, the resulting ionization charge 
generates an electric signal along the central 
wire which propagates towards the two ends of 
the straw and to the front-end electronics, 
where TDCs measure the signal arrival 
times $t_1$ and $t_2$. The primary goal of 
the time calibration is enabling the 
determination of the track position 
along the straw from the measurement of 
the arrival times $t_1$ and $t_2$. 
The dependence of $t_1$ and $t_2$ on the track 
position $x_{track}$ is given by the following equations:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    t_1 &= t_0 + \frac{x_{\text{track}}}{v} + t_d + d_1 \\
    t_2 &= t_0 + \frac{L - x_{\text{track}}}{v} + t_d + d_2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $t_0$ is the particle's crossing time, 
$t_d$ is the drift time in the straw, 
$L$ is the length of the straw, 
$x_{\text{track}}$ is the 
reconstructed track position on the wire, $v$ 
is the propagation velocity of 
the electric signal along the central 
wire and $d_i$ are the delays  
introduced by the front end electronics. 
$t_1$ and $t_2$ are measured  
by the TDC timing on the HV side and on the CAL side.
The measurement of the difference 
$\Delta t_{12}=t_1-t_2$ allows 
determining the coordinate $x_{\text{track}}$, 
while $(t_1 + t_2) / 2$ allows to measure the drift time  
up to an offset common to all channels. 
If we subtract and add the two equations, we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{ffffff}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta t_{12} &= \frac{2x_{\text{track}}-L}{v} +(d_1-d_2)  \\
        \frac{(t_1 + t_2)}{2} &= t_d+t_0+\frac{d_1+d_2}{2}-\cfrac{L}{2v} 
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
The first equation contains the time 
difference $\Delta t_{12}$ between the 
signals at the two straw ends as measured 
by the TDCs, the reconstructed track coordinate 
$x_{track}$ along the wire, the propagation 
velocity $v$ of the signal along the wire and 
the difference $d_1-d_2$ between the delays introduced by 
the front-end electronics. 
Performing the time calibration means 
determining $v$ and $d1-d2$ from the $\Delta t_{12}$ 
measured by the TDCs and from an independent 
reconstruction of the track 
projected on the wire ($x_{track}$).
This type of calibration will be 
achieved using cosmic rays. 
At the moment of the very first calibration, 
the only available spatial information is 
whether a straw has been hit or not. The 
only way to obtain $x_{track}$ from a "yes or no" 
information is to use the tracker station 
geometry and the relative rotation angle between straws. 
To determine $v$ in the first equation of \ref{ffffff}, 
an unbiased reconstruction of the 
track projected on the wires is needed.


\subsection{Operational constraints of the station}\label{gassystem}

Figure \ref{fig:gassystem}  shows a schematic representation of the fully assembled tracker. Clearly, the
entire detector, its infrastrucures and services, and, consequently, the stations have been
designed for being operated in what we call $vertical$ $orientation$, which is the orientation of
the detector in Mu2e. This choice has now an impact in several aspects: from the storage and
handling tools of the fully assembled and equipped station, which is a very fragile system, to
the available services, for example the gas distribution system, which have been designed for
managing, moving and operating a complex detector with a specific orientation, and may not
allow to move and operate even one of its building blocks, one single station, in a different
orientation. The most reasonable orientation of the station for a test with
cosmic muons is the $horizontal$ $orientation$, that facilitates unbiased 
reconstruction, since cosmic muons are distributed according to 
cos$^2\theta$ and they are predominantly vertical 
(Section \ref{distcos}), thus crossing the straws mostly perpendicularly.
We first checked the operational constraints
which may not allow to operate the station horizontally.
Apparently, the main challenge with the horizontal orientation is the operation of the gas
distribution system. The gas distribution system of the panel is equipped with two check valces:
the first one is located on the supply side, the second one on the exhaust side. These valves
operate using a simple mechanism where a ball is pressed onto an O-ring to form a seal. The
only operational mode for these valves is to be oriented vertically to ensure proper sealing. In
our specific case, this is not an issue for the check valves on the supply side, since they should
be kept open during calibration with the gas flowing. On the other hand, the check valves on
the exhaust side of the panel must be closed at all times to prevent gas from leaking before
reaching the panel. Figure \ref{fig:gassystem} shows a schematic 
representation of the operational mode of the supply 
and exhaust valves. The red arrows represent the 
direction of the gas flow. On the supply side (Figure 
\ref{fig:gassystem} (Left)), the ball has to rest on the 
O-ring, or the gas flows downwards towards the atmosphere, 
rather than flowing upwards towards the panel. According 
to these specifications, it seems that the only operational 
mode of the station is in the vertical position. 
Additionally, other reasons include space constraints, as placing 
a station horizontally takes up significantly more room space than 
vertically. Moreover, the station is quite fragile, and 
excessive movement could lead to potential issues.

To achieve good momentum resolution, a resolution of at least 4 cm 
is required on the tracker straws. In the following sections, I will 
introduce the simulation performed to reconstruct cosmic tracks 
with a vertically oriented station, with the aim of understanding 
potential biases in determining the longitudinal position due to 
the non-uniform illumination of a panel.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \caption[Schematic view of the valves located in a tracker panel.]{Schematic view of the valves located in a tracker panel.}
    \label{fig:gassystem}
\end{figure}
To ensure optimal performance during Mu2e data-taking, it's essential to 
conduct the initial calibration with the system in a vertical orientation. 
This helps us achieve conditions that closely 
match those of the actual detector. However, if the vertical 
orientation doesn't prove useful for calibration, 
we will need to explore new mechanical solutions.

For this reason, in this Chapter I will report on a simulation study 
which shows that the vertical orientation introduces a significant bias on 
the $x_{track}$ which does not allow to perform the station 
calibration. 



\section{Cosmic muons as a calibration source}
Cosmic muons will play a fundamental role in the 
calibration of the entire Mu2e detector system and, 
in particular, the tracker. They have unique 
characteristics that make calibration with cosmic rays 
complementary to other techniques:

 

\begin{itemize}
    \item calibration samples with cosmic muons 
    can be taken during standard detector operations, 
    with the same detector conditions as the physics samples;
    \item the cosmic muons flux 
    ($\sim 1 \ \text{cm}^{-2} \text{min}^{-1}$ 
    for horizontal detectors with a mean
    energy of $\sim$4 GeV, Ref. \cite{muonflux}) 
    is sufficient to allow
    collecting a substantial amount of calibration 
    data in a relatively short time and 
    thus monitoring continuously the detector response;
    \item a cosmic muon is a minimum ionizing 
    particle (MIP) and 
    its energy loss is almost 
    independent of its energy;
    \item the speed of the cosmic muons is equal to the 
    speed of light $c$, and the time they take to traverse 
    a detector, in our case one tracker station, can be 
    used to align the time offsets of all the channels  
    without any external time reference.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cosmic muons energy and angular distribution}\label{distcos}
The muon flux at sea level is usually described by the standard Gaisser's formula, Ref. \cite{guan2015parametrization}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d I}{d E_\mu d \Omega d t d S}=\frac{0.14}{\mathrm{~cm}^2 \mathrm{~s} \ \mathrm{sr}}\left(\frac{E_\mu}{\mathrm{GeV}}\right)^{-2.7} \quad\left[\frac{1}{1+\frac{1.1 E_\mu \cos \theta}{115 \mathrm{GeV}}}+\frac{0.054}{1+\frac{1.1 E_\mu \cos \theta}{850 \mathrm{GeV}}}\right]
    \end{equation}
where $E_\mu$ is the muon energy and $\theta$ is the polar angle of the muon. 
The two terms in brackets correspond to the contribution of the charged pions and kaons, while 
the small contribution from charm and heavier flavors is neglected. 
This simplified formula doesn't take into account muon decays and the curvature of the Earth, 
thus it is only valid for zenith angles $\theta < 70^\circ$ and for energies $E > \frac{100}{\cos \theta}$ GeV.
A modified version of the standard Gaisser formula, called Gaisser Tang model, is used to account for low energy and large zenith angle effects, Ref. \cite{guan2015parametrization}:
\begin{equation}\label{cosmicmuonflux}
    \frac{d I}{d E_\mu d \Omega d t d S}=\frac{0.14}{\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{~s} \ \mathrm{sr} }\left( \frac{E_\mu}{\mathrm{GeV}} \left(1+\frac{3.64 \mathrm{GeV}}{E_\mu\left(\cos \theta^*\right)^{1.29}}\right)\right)^{-2.7}\left[\frac{1}{1+\frac{1.1 E_\mu \cos \theta^*}{115 \mathrm{GeV}}}+\frac{0.054}{1+\frac{1.1 E_\mu \cos \theta^*}{850 \mathrm{GeV}}}\right]
\end{equation}
where the second term in the bracket is the same as in the standard formula, except that the zenith angle 
$\theta$ is substituted by the angle $\theta^*$. The relation between cos$\theta$
and cos$\theta^*$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \cos \theta^*=\sqrt{\frac{(\cos \theta)^2+P_1^2+P_2(\cos \theta)^{P_3}+P_4(\cos \theta)^{P_5}}{1+P_1^2+P_2+P_4}}
    \end{equation}
The parameters $P_1$ = 0.102573, $P_2$ = -0.068287, $P_3$ = 0.958633, $P_4$ = 0.0407253, and $P_5$ = 0.817285 were calculated using 
a dedicated simulation of muon production in the atmosphere. A representation of the angles is shown in Figure \ref{fig:anglesinmuon}.
Another factor is included in Equation \ref{cosmicmuonflux} to account for the possibility of muon decays, which are more 
significant at low energies. The numerical constants are derived by fitting experimental data from various cosmic muon studies.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Monte Carlo cosmic generation with CRY}
Several Monte Carlo programs allow to simulate sea-level 
cosmic ray muons: the most widely used is CRY, developed 
by LANL. CRY functions as a generator for air showers 
induced by primary cosmic rays. The CRY package uses 
precomputed input tables derived from comprehensive 
MCNPX 2.5.0 simulation of protons in the energy range 
between 1 GeV and 100 TeV, at the top of the atmosphere.
The generation of muons and other secondary particles 
is governed by the pion and kaon decays. The package 
generates the cosmic muon flux within a zenith angle range 
of 0-90°, following a cos$^2 \theta$ distribution, and an 
energy range between 1-100 GeV, following the Gaisser 
Tang parameterization.The CRY package accounts for the 
dependence of cosmic muon flux on various parameters, 
including altitude, latitude, and solar activity. CRY 
provides muon flux data at three different altitudes: 
sea level, 2100 m, and 11300 m, with sea level being 
selected for this study. The latitude is set at 41.8° N, 
corresponding to Fermilab. To avoid variations of the 
primary cosmic muon flux due to solar activity, I chose 
a common day (6-21-2021) outside the maximum and minimum 
sunspot cycle for the simulation. While there are other 
packages designed to produce cosmic muons with specific 
energy and zenith angles, such as CORSIKA, I chose CRY 
for its straightforward implementation and compatibility with GEANT4. 

\subsection{Monte Carlo sample and coordinate system }\label{genplane}
I generated a sample of cosmic muons with a uniform distribution within a
horizontal plane approximately 11 m above the muon beam axis. The GEANT4 
simulation also incorporates the effects of the external neutron shield surrounding the DS 
and the concrete ceiling of the Mu2e experimental hall. Starting from the generation plane, 
cosmic muons pass through the concrete ceiling and walls situated outside the experimental hall. 
As they propagate downwards to the detector, they interact with the building materials. 
The external neutron shield surrounding the DS consists of concrete ($\rho$=2.3 g/cm$^3$) of  
roughly 0.9 m thickness, while the ceiling above the Mu2e experimental area comprises 1.8 m of concrete. 
The entire structure is enclosed within a volume of air at standard temperature and pressure.

I performed the simulation of the station in what in Mu2e jargon is called
"extracted position", which means the station was placed outside the solenoid.
Given that the Earth's magnetic field is approximately 
$4 \div 5 \times 10^{-5}$ T, 
and considering that the dimensions of the station are 
on the order of 1-2 m, 
along with the fact that the majority of particles 
under consideration have energies around $\sim$ 10 GeV, 
the curvature radius of the particles is approximately 
$R\sim p[\text{GeV}]/(B[\text{T}]\cdot 0.3) \sim 700$ km. 
This radius is significantly larger than the station's 
dimensions, allowing us to reconstruct particle trajectories 
as straight lines.
For this reason, in the simulation we used a 
magnetic field intensity equal to zero. 

Before starting explaining the event selection and the 
reconstruction, let me define the coordinate system, 
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:coordinate}. The $z$ axis is parallel to 
the DS axis, while the $y$ axis corresponds to the vertical axis.
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.5\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240526_164527.png}
    \caption[Schematic view of a tracker station and the coordinate system.]{Schematic view of a tracker station and definition of the coordinate system used for the analysis.}
    \label{fig:coordinate}
\end{figure}
\section{Monte Carlo event selection}\label{eventselection}

Since in the Mu2e simulation the tracker is made of 18 stations, to 
perform this study, we selected only those events where a cosmic 
muon crosses one single station.
One station is made of two planes, one plane is made of two faces, and one face is
made of three panels (Section \ref{geomtra}). The geometry of the station 
is thus very simple: it is a detector made of four parallel 
layers orthogonal to the $z$ axis, with a total thickness of less than 10 cm.
Although the station has globally four layers, 
the panel geometry does not provide a uniform
volume coverage: there are regions of the 
detector where a particle with a trajectory orthogonal
to the panel may cross four, three, two or even only one 
detector layer (Figure \ref{fig:coordinate}). Given the
rotation angles of the panels within the same 
face and between different faces, if this particle
crosses four layers, the straws of the four 
panels are not parallel to each other.
Each straw can be parametrized as a straight line 
lying on a plane $z = z_i$, where $z_i$ is the $z$ 
coordinate of the panel which contains the straw:
\begin{equation}\label{equaretta}
    (D_{x,i}t+M_{x,i},D_{y,i}t+M_{y,i},z_i)
\end{equation}
where $D_{x,i}$, $D_{y,i}$ are the $x$ and $y$ 
$i$-th straws' directions, while $M_{x,i}$, $M_{y,i}$ 
are the $x$, $y$ straws' midpoints.
%One dimension is correlated with the other two, so we have just two informationful dimensions.
In this parametrization, the straws are all parallel 
on the $y-z$ plane.

To conduct this study, it is necessary to 
reconstruct the 3D trajectory of the cosmic muon, 
which requires at least two 3D points along the muon's 
trajectory. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of 
the each required 3D point can be determined 
from the intersection of one pair of non-parallel 
straws. Since all straws 
within a single panel are parallel to each other, 
more than one hit per face is needed. The 3D intersection $z$ 
coordinate is determined as the average of the 
straws' $z$ coordinates. Thus, to avoid selecting 
parallel straws in the same plane, 
the first selection cut 
was to require at least one hit per face. 
This first requirement will be denoted as 
4/4 request in the following sections.

Since multiple hits can occur within a 
single panel due to signal spread, another 
selection criterion was to choose events 
with fewer than three hit straws per panel. 
This criterion was selected to minimize errors 
in track reconstruction.
\subsection{Panel illumination pattern}
To perform an accurate calibration, 
the distribution of the hits across the panel 
should be as
uniform as possible. On the other hand, this is 
not what we obtain, due to the station geometry
and the applied selection cuts. 
Figure \ref{fig:illumination} shows the 
resulting hit distribution for panel 0 of
plane 0, which corresponds 
to the panel in 
the upper right part of Figure \ref{fig:coordinate}, 
after applying the selection cuts 
outlined in Section 
\ref{eventselection}. 
We picked this panel as one possible 
example, the 
distributions for all the planes in 
both planes are similar, as
shown in Appendix \ref{appendix2}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.8\textwidth]{figures/pdf/xp_vs_yp_panel0.pdf}
    \caption[Monte Carlo illumination across 
    the panel (panel 0, plane 0).]{
        The Monte Carlo illumination 
        across the panel (panel 0, plane 0).
        The selection requires cosmic muons which 
        traverse four faces within one station, with 
        fewer than three hits per panel.}
    \label{fig:illumination}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:illumination} shows a 
non-uniform, or spotty, 
panel illumination. This is due to the 4/4 request: 
given the station geometry, the only 4/4 overlap 
regions are 
limited to the edges of the panels (darkest 
areas in Figure \ref{fig:coordinate}). 

Moreover, the 4/4 request selects specific 
muon directions in the $y$-$z$ plane. 
Figure \ref{fig:myz} shows the 
$m_{yz}=\Delta y /\Delta z$ distribution 
for the selected muons. 
As expected, there are no particles corresponding 
to the $m_{yz}\sim 0$, which corresponds to the  
horizontal direction and 
$m_{yz} \rightarrow \infty$ (vertical), since the 
4/4 request is not satisfied by vertical muons. 
The consequence of the 4/4 request is also a 
significant reduction of the total muon rate 
(Section \ref{ratetracker}). 
The selected muon  
directions tend to have  
$|m_{yz}| \sim 1$, which correspond to  
an angle of approximately 45°.
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.8\textwidth]{figures/pdf/myz.pdf}
    \caption[The $y-z$ direction 
    distribution of muons satisfying 4/4 request.]{
        $m_{yz}=\Delta y /\Delta z$  
    distribution of muons satisfying 4/4 request.}
    \label{fig:myz}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:illumination} 
shows that there are almost no hits in the 
panel central region. This could result in 
waveform non-linearities: the signals generated by 
particles which pass close to the edges of 
the straw tend to be wider, and wider signals 
have greater charge and height compared 
to the signals coming from the 
central part of the wire. Consequently, the leading 
edge could be very sharp, potentially 
causing timing systematics. 

\subsection{Expected muon rate}\label{ratetracker}
The rate of cosmics generated on the horizontal 
plane above the beam axis can be computed by 
integrating the flux on the solid angle, on 
the muon energy described in Section \ref{genplane}:
\begin{equation}
   R= \int \frac{\text{d} I}{d E_\mu \text{d} \Omega \text{d} t \text{d} S} \text{d} S_{\perp} \text{d} \Omega \text{d} E_\mu
    \end{equation}
where $\text{d}S_\perp= \text{d}S \text{cos}\theta$ 
is the projection of the surface element on the 
plane perpendicular to the cosmics flux. 
The energy and angle ranges selected for this 
simulation are respectively 0.5 GeV < $E_\mu$ < 500 GeV, 
which selects the muons not absorbed in the 
concrete layer posed above the tracker, 
and 0° < $\theta^*$ < 90°. 
If we consider a generation plane of area  
$\sim 5$ m$^2$, the resulting rate is $R \sim 380$ Hz. 
%The rate of cosmic muons detected by each straw, $R_{straw}$, can be easily obtained as:
%\begin{equation}
%    R_{straw}=\frac{R}{(N_{faces}\cdot N_{panels}\cdot N_{straws} )}
%\end{equation}
%where $N_{faces}=4$ is the number of hit faces, $N_{panels}=3$ is the number of panels in one face and $N_{straws}=96$ is the number of straws in one panel.
%The resulting rate is about 0.5 Hz. This simple computation does not take into account the complicated tracker geometry and the station orientation.
%Let us normalize by a factor that is the ratio between the number of selected events and the total number of produced events, which is about 
%$\sim10^{-3}$. The rate then changes to $\sim$ mHz. 
%To perform a proper calibration, at least $\sim$1000 hits per straw are needed, which requires at least 8 days of data taking.
%This rate calculation is quite straightforward, but the duration required for such a simple calibration is notably long.
The number of generated events 
was chosen to be $N_{gen}\sim 2\times 10^8$, since the 
number of cosmics that 
hit a station is about 8$\times 10^5$ and 
this is a good number of events to perform 
a reasonable calibration.
Simulating 2$\times 10^8$ cosmic 
muons on the horizontal plane allows for an 
approximate estimate of the time necessary to 
collect a data sample sufficient to perform the 
calibration, that is
$\Delta t = N_{gen}/R\sim 6$ days, which is 
excessively long 
for such a simple calibration. 

\section{Reconstructing the muon tracks}\label{reconstruction}
To determine $x_{track}$ in Equation \ref{ffffff}, 
it is necessary to reconstruct 3D muon track 
starting from the stereo hit coordinates.
As mentioned in equation \ref{equaretta}, 
what we know about each single straw is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the straw direction $(D_{x,i},D_{y,i})$;
    \item the straw midpoints $(M_{x,i},M_{y,i})$;
    \item the straw $z_i$ coordinate.
\end{itemize} 
The reconstruction process begins 
with the sole information of whether 
a straw has been hit or not.
To improve the hit spatial resolution, adjacent 
straws simultaneously hit, which have been most 
likely crossed by the same muon, are combined 
and form the object called $ClusterHit$. 
A maximum of three straws are used to reconstruct a 
$ClusterHit$, to minimize the uncertainty on 
the determination of the 3D intersection points.
This new object effectively represents a 
straw with the same direction and the midpoint 
computed as the average of the midpoints of the straw 
which make it. Since we have selected muons which 
have hits in four panels in four different 
faces, four $ClusterHit$s are reconstructed 
within a station. The new $ClusterHit$ 
midpoints will be referred to as 
$(x_{m,i}, y_{m,i}, z_{m,i})$.
Two $ClusterHit$s in the two faces of the same 
plane are combined to determine one $StereoHit$ on 
the $x-y$ plane. 
The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the 
$StereoHit$ are determined by the 
intersection point of the two 
$ClusterHit$s. The $z$ coordinate of 
the $StereoHit$ is the average of the 
$z$ coordinates of the $ClusterHit$s.
This is reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:stco}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =0.6\textwidth]{figures/png/Screenshot_20240810_210144.png}
    \caption[Schematic view of a cosmic muon hitting the vertical oriented station.]{Schematic view of a cosmic muon (light blue) hitting the vertical oriented station. The red lines are the $ClusterHit$s, the dark blue dots 
    are the $StrawHit$s and the green dots are the $StereoHit$s.}
    \label{fig:stco}
\end{figure}
Considering only one plane and the following 
equations as the $x-y$ $ComboHit$s equations:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        y&=\frac{v_1}{u_1}(x-x_{m,1})+y_{m,1} \\
        y&=\frac{v_2}{u_2}(x-x_{m,2})+y_{m,2} 
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
where $u_i$ is the $ClusterHit$ $x$ direction and $v_i$ is the $ClusterHit$ $y$ direction, the $StereoHit$ coordinates will be:
\begin{equation}\label{x}
    \begin{aligned}
x&=\frac{u_1 u_2(y_{m,1}-y_{m,2}+\frac{v_2}{u_2}x_{m,2}-\frac{v_1}{u_1}x_{m,1})}{v_2 u_1 - v_1 u_2}\\
y&=\frac{v_2}{u_2}\left(\frac{u_1 u_2(y_{m,1}-y_{m,2}+\frac{v_2}{u_2}x_{m,2}-\frac{v_1}{u_1}x_{m,1})}{v_2 u_1 - v_1 u_2}-x_{m,2}\right)+y_{m,2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In two different planes, there are two $StereoHit$s available, allowing for the reconstruction of the track on $x-y$ and $y-z$ planes. 
Referring to these $StereoHit$s as $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ respectively, the final track slope on $x-y$ plane will be 
denoted as $m_{xy}$, while on the $y-z$ plane it will be denoted as $m_{yz}$. The corresponding $y$-intercepts will be $q_{xy}$ and $q_{yz}$.
The formulas for computing these parameters are as follows:
\begin{equation}

m_{xy}&=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
q_{xy}&=-m_{xy} \cdot x_1+y_1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
m_{yz}&=\frac{y_2-y_1}{z_2-z_1}\\
q_{yz}&=-m_{yz} \cdot z_1+y_1

To determine the four hit positions of the reconstructed track on the panels, we need to intersect the track with the panels' $z_i$ coordinates. 
The reconstructed hits on the panels will be denoted as $R_{x,i}$ and $R_{y,i}$.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
 R_{y,i}&=m_{yz}\cdot z_i+q_{yz}\\
 R_{x,i}&=\frac{(m_{yz}\cdot z_i+q_{yz}-q_{xy})}{m_{xy}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The bias on the longitudinal position is the difference between the reconstructed coordinate and the true Monte Carlo position in the panel frame.

\section{Results}
The simulation shows that a resolution on the 
hit position along the straw ($x_{track}$) 
better than 4 cm is necessary to achieve the 
momentum resolution necessary for Mu2e physics goals.
With this study, we need to verify that the 
calibration procedure is consistent with 
this requirement. In particular, since the 
procedure allows to perform an approximate reconstruction 
of the muon track and, thus, of the extrapolated track 
position on the panel, we need to carefully determine 
what is the bias introduced by this procedure,  
to make sure it is well below the threshold of 4 cm.  
Figure \ref{fig:recx} shows the reconstructed 
longitudinal coordinate $x_{track}$, which is 
determined as the intersection of the reconstructed 
muon track with the mean $z_i$ 
coordinate of the panel, for panel 0, which may 
be taken as a good representative for all the panels.
Similar patterns were observed for all 
panels. In this distribution, the bumps 
are a consequence of the 4/4 
requirement and the panels' overlap areas 
being located at the extreme edges. 
It is important to observe that 
different bumps correspond to different 
straws, as can also be seen in Figure 
\ref{fig:illumination}.

Figure \ref{fig:bias} shows the difference   
between the reconstructed track on the panel 
and true longitudinal coordinates. 
The true coordinate is computed as the mean coordinate 
of the Monte Carlo hits. 
The bias range is approximately [-6, 6] cm, 
indicating a significant systematic factor 
affecting the hit reconstruction. The 
distribution is nearly symmetric, similar 
for all panels. 
There are four peaks corresponding to the 
four different spots shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:illumination}.

The 2D distribution of the longitudinal bias 
versus the true position, shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:rec2D}, shows four different 
spots on the $x$ axis corresponding to 
the overlap regions. Each spot refers to 
different straws. The two spots on the $y$ 
axis correspond to cosmics with different orientations. 
The first spot (CAL side) correspond to 90° 
panels overlap.

    \label{fig:rec2D}
\end{figure}
To assess the systematic impact on the 
reconstructed coordinates, it is essential 
to visualize the TProfile of the bias versus 
the true coordinates. 
Profile histograms are used to represent the 
mean value of $y$ and its error for each bin in $x$. 
The default displayed error is the standard 
error on the mean. 
The TProfile is reported in Figure \ref{fig:profile}. 
It reveals a systematic effect in determining the 
longitudinal position within a range exceeding 
[-4,4] cm. The initial portion of the 
histogram (CAL side) 
corresponds to the overlap of 90° panels. 
This plot suggests that the mean may not 
serve as an accurate estimator of the bias. 
Under these conditions, the calibration is 
expected to become challenging.

\end{figure}
The main issue with this type of reconstruction 
lies in the fact that $m_{yz}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta z}$ 
is not accurately reconstructed. Consequently, 
the reconstructed coordinates depend on this 
value, as demonstrated in Section \ref{reconstruction}. 
This discrepancy arises when the true hit 
position, far from the midpoint of the straws, 
results in incorrectly reconstructed tracks'
direction on the $y-z$ plane, leading to the erroneous 
reconstruciton of cosmic muons as horizontal tracks.
Figure \ref{fig:myzrec} shows the 
reconstructed $m_{yz}$ distribution, highlighting 
a significant peak at the value of 0, 
corresponding to cosmic muons erroneously 
reconstructed as horizontal, which 
are not possible in reality. We know there are 
no horizontal muons in our sample, as can be seen 
from Figure \ref{fig:myz}.

\section{Conclusions}
The Mu2e collaboration considered 
that a vertical station calibration might be 
feasible for our goals.
This Chapter demonstrated that the vertical orientation for calibrating a station is not optimal. This is due to several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The selection criteria in Section \ref{eventselection} select cosmic muons with orientations that affect panel illumination. 
    The illumination is non-uniform, and moreover, there are almost no hits in the central region of the panel, which could result in waveform non-linearities;
    \item The rate of cosmic events is $R \sim 380$ Hz, and the expected duration of the calibration is about 6 days without interruptions, 
    which is excessive for the simple calibration we intend to perform;
    \item The bias range is approximately [-6, 6] cm. The 2D distribution of the longitudinal bias versus the true position shows 
    four distinct spots on the $x$ axis corresponding to the overlap regions. Each spot refers to different straws.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, an alternative orientation or method should be considered to optimize the calibration process and achieve more accurate results.
For this reason, a new mechanical approach 
to address the problems outlined in Section \ref{gassystem}  
is currently under development.

%As discussed in Chapter 3, the Mu2e Tracker panels need to satisfy a series of performance
%requirements for successful operations and the designed resolution. While various individual
%component and single panel tests in the past confirmed their respective effectiveness, it was of great
%interest to extend the tests to a system of multiple panels over a longer period of time under a more
%realistic setup (i.e., similar to that of the actual experiment setup), and to get better quantitative
%understandings of the detector performances. Hence, a VST was conducted.
%The overall goal of the VST was to “exercise the full tracker operation and readout chain,
%from the amplified wire signal to its storage in digitized format” [1]. The test used a whole plane of
%six panels from panel pre-production,1 which was 1/36 of the full Tracker.
%The VST contained two phases. In the first phase, the plane was laid horizontally on a
%test bench for diagnostics and horizontal position runs, as shown in Figure 5.1(a). In the figure
%the supporting systems, including gas lines, DC-to-DC converters for low voltage supplies, high
%voltage supplies, and the Raspberry Pi (marked as RPi) for panel controls, are all labeled.2 In this
%phase, the plane operations and performances were checked. The plane data output to the DAQ
%server through the optical fiber links (see Chapter 4 and Appendix B) were finalized and tested.
%Small cosmic-ray datasets werereconstruction of the track longitudinal position taken to verify the ability to synchronize data taking among the

%We also plan to take significant amounts of cosmic ray data in at least two configurations. First, cosmic ray data will be taken with the plane in the current horizontal
%position. This will be taken using a modified readout scheme involving the serial
%connection as described above. Software exists to take the output raw data and manually convert it into an art format that can be processed by the official Mu2e software
%packages. This first cosmic data will be used to confirm the functionality of the system - including a cross-check of the panel to panel time synchronization, and the
%overall timing measurement performance. 
%Additionally, enough statistics could allow
%for important preliminary calibrations of delta-t resolution, longitudinal propagation
%velocities, efficiencies, and channel to channel variations. The fairly uniform distribution and wide phase-space of tracks in the horizontal configuration can make these
%analyses more straightforward than in the vertical configuration. Additionally a better measure of the expected showering will allow an improved analysis of vertical data.
%Finally, it may be possible to make some measure of the difference between vertical
%and horizontal straw alignment compared to expectations from Duke measurements
%and gravitational sag
%Later, the plane will be positioned vertically and another month of cosmic data
%will be taken. At this point readout may be through the fiber and DTC for improved
%livetime. As described above we will move towards automatic processing of this
%data and have it copied and backed up to tape. This data will be most useful for
%testing the track reconstruction. There exists software for reconstructing cosmic
%tracks without a magnetic field, and it has been tested in a limited fashion with
%data from a single vertical panel (docdb-33914). The implementation for a single
%plane in either horizontal or vertical configuration is being developed.
%Finally, a more thorough calibration of the plane can be done using a systematic
%scan across each panel with an Fe55 source. This will allow further measurements of
%the response as a function of straw and position, and a determination of the variability
%between panels.
